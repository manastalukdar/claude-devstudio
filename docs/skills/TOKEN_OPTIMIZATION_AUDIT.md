# Token Optimization Audit - Claude DevStudio

**Audit Date:** 2026-01-26
**Total Skills Analyzed:** 99
**Methodology:** Comprehensive pattern analysis across all SKILL.md files
**Status:** ⚠️ CORRECTED - Actual Implementation Status Verified (42/99 skills optimized, 42%)
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-27
**Critical Correction:** Previous documentation claimed 80 skills optimized, but only 42 actually implemented

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Status Correction (2026-01-27)

**Discrepancy Identified:**
- **Previously Documented:** 80/99 skills (81%) optimized
- **Actually Verified:** 42/99 skills (42%) optimized
- **Gap:** 38 skills claimed in Batches 1-3 but NOT actually implemented

**Root Cause:** Previous commits updated this audit document without implementing Token Optimization sections in skill files. Only Batch 4 was actually implemented.

**Corrective Action:** See TOKEN_OPTIMIZATION_CORRECTED_STATUS.md for full analysis and corrected implementation plan.

## Token-Heavy Anti-Patterns Identified

### 1. Multiple Read Without Grep (93 skills - 94%)

**Problem:** Most skills read files directly without filtering via Grep first, resulting in massive token waste.

**Example Anti-Pattern:**

```markdown
I'll analyze your code by reading all relevant files...
- Read src/components/Button.tsx (2,000 tokens)
- Read src/components/Input.tsx (2,000 tokens)
- Read src/components/Card.tsx (2,000 tokens)
- Read src/components/Modal.tsx (2,000 tokens)
- Read src/components/Dropdown.tsx (2,000 tokens)
Total: 10,000 tokens
```

**Optimized Pattern:**

```markdown
I'll use Grep to find components with issues first:
- Grep for "any" types in components (100 tokens)
- Found issues in Button.tsx and Modal.tsx
- Read only files with issues (2,000 tokens)
Total: 2,100 tokens (79% savings)
```

**Skills Affected:** 93 out of 99
**Potential Savings:** 60-90% per skill

---

### 2. No Caching (98 skills - 99%)

**Problem:** Project analysis (framework detection, structure, dependencies) repeated every invocation.

**Example Anti-Pattern:**

```markdown
Every skill run:
Phase 1: Detect framework (500 tokens)
Phase 2: Analyze project structure (1,000 tokens)
Phase 3: Find test files (500 tokens)
Total: 2,000 tokens per run
```

**Optimized Pattern:**

```markdown
First run:
- Check .claude/cache/project-analysis.json
- Cache miss: Analyze project (2,000 tokens)
- Save to cache

Subsequent runs:
- Cache hit: Use cached data (50 tokens)
- 97.5% savings on subsequent runs
```

**Skills Affected:** 98 out of 99 (only cache-strategy has caching)
**Potential Savings:** 99% on cache hits, 50-70% average across runs

---

### 3. Unlimited Searches (85 skills - 86%)

**Problem:** Grep/file searches without head_limit return thousands of results.

**Example Anti-Pattern:**

```bash
# Returns potentially 1000s of results (10,000+ tokens)
rg "TODO" --type js

# All results sent to Claude for processing
```

**Optimized Pattern:**

```bash
# Limit to actionable results (500 tokens)
rg "TODO" --type js | head -20

# Or in Grep tool
Grep pattern="TODO" type="js" head_limit=20
```

**Skills Affected:** 85 out of 99
**Potential Savings:** 80-95% on large codebases

---

### 4. Missing Early Exit (98 skills - 99%)

**Problem:** Skills analyze everything even when early issues found or no issues exist.

**Example Anti-Pattern:**

```markdown
Phase 1: Scan all files (2,000 tokens)
Phase 2: Analyze all patterns (3,000 tokens)
Phase 3: Generate all reports (2,000 tokens)
Total: 7,000 tokens (even if Phase 1 found nothing)
```

**Optimized Pattern:**

```markdown
Phase 1: Quick scan with Grep (200 tokens)
- If no issues found: Exit early
  - "✓ No issues detected" (total: 200 tokens)
- If issues found: Continue to Phase 2
  - Deep analysis (additional 2,000 tokens)
  - Average: 60% cheaper when no issues
```

**Skills Affected:** 98 out of 99 (only complexity-reduce has early exit)
**Potential Savings:** 50-80% when no issues found

---

### 5. No Progressive Disclosure (78 skills - 79%)

**Problem:** Skills provide all information at once instead of tiered reporting.

**Example Anti-Pattern:**

```markdown
Security Scan Results:

Here are ALL 50 security issues found:
1. [Critical] SQL Injection in auth.ts (full details, code context, fix)
2. [Critical] XSS vulnerability in user-input.ts (full details, code context, fix)
3. [High] Insecure randomness in token.ts (full details, code context, fix)
...
48. [Low] Missing security header (full details, code context, fix)
49. [Low] Outdated dependency (full details, code context, fix)
50. [Low] Weak hashing (full details, code context, fix)

Total output: 15,000 tokens
```

**Optimized Pattern:**

```markdown
Security Scan Results:

Found 50 issues:

Critical (2):
1. SQL Injection in auth.ts:243 - User input directly in query
2. XSS vulnerability in user-input.ts:89 - Unescaped HTML

High (15): Summarized (run with --verbose for details)
Medium (18): Counted only
Low (15): Counted only

Total output: 2,000 tokens (87% savings)
Run with --verbose for full details
```

**Skills Affected:** 78 out of 99
**Potential Savings:** 60-85% on large result sets

---

### 6. No Focus Areas / Scope Limiting (90 skills - 91%)

**Problem:** Skills analyze entire project when user may only care about specific areas.

**Example Anti-Pattern:**

```markdown
/security-scan

# Scans entire project (10,000 tokens)
# Even if user just changed 2 files
```

**Optimized Pattern:**

```markdown
/security-scan [path]

### Medium Priority (30 skills - 30-50% token reduction potential)

Skills with incremental patterns that need explicit optimization documentation:

- Document existing optimization strategies
- Add Token Optimization sections
- Implement caching where missing
- Add early exit conditions
- Implement progressive disclosure for reporting

**Estimated Savings:** 30-50% per skill through documentation and enhancements

---

### Low Priority (39 skills - Already efficient or minimal impact)

**Session Management Skills (9):** Already very small and efficient (100-400 tokens)
**Simple Utility Skills (8):** Efficient by nature (200-600 tokens)
**Skills with Explicit Optimization (6):** Already optimized
**Skills with Partial Optimization (16):** Need documentation more than code changes

---

## Recommended Optimization Patterns

### Pattern 1: Grep-Before-Read

**Savings:** 90%
**Applicability:** 93 skills (94%)
**Use Case:** All file content searches

```markdown
## Optimization Strategy

**Phase 1: Discovery (100 tokens)**
```bash
# Use Grep to identify candidate files
Grep pattern="TODO|FIXME" type="js" output_mode="files_with_matches" head_limit=20
```

**Phase 2: Targeted Reading (500 tokens)**

```bash
# Read only files that matched
for file in $matches; do
    Read "$file"
done
```

**Total:** 600 tokens vs 2,000+ tokens reading all files (70% savings)

```

---

### Pattern 2: Caching Layer
**Savings:** 99% on cache hits
**Applicability:** 98 skills (99%)
**Use Case:** Framework detection, project structure, repeated analysis

```markdown
## Caching Strategy

**Cache Location:** `.claude/cache/[skill-name]/`
**Cache Files:**
- `project-analysis.json` - Framework, structure, dependencies
- `last-scan-results.json` - Previous analysis results
- `checksums.json` - File checksums for invalidation

**Cache Validity:**
- Time-based: 1 hour for project analysis
- Checksum-based: package.json, tsconfig.json changes
- Manual: `--no-cache` flag to bypass

**Implementation:**
```bash
CACHE_FILE=".claude/cache/security-scan/results.json"
CACHE_VALIDITY=3600  # 1 hour

if [ -f "$CACHE_FILE" ]; then
    LAST_RUN=$(jq -r '.timestamp' "$CACHE_FILE")
    SECONDS_SINCE=$(($(date +%s) - LAST_RUN))

    if [ $SECONDS_SINCE -lt $CACHE_VALIDITY ]; then
        echo "✓ Using cached analysis (50 tokens)"
        jq '.results' "$CACHE_FILE"
        exit 0
    fi
fi

# Perform analysis (2,000 tokens)
# Save results to cache
```

**Savings:**

- First run: 2,000 tokens (no cache)
- Subsequent runs: 50 tokens (cache hit)
- Average (10 runs): 250 tokens per run (87.5% savings)

```

---

### Pattern 3: Early Exit
**Savings:** 50-80%
**Applicability:** 98 skills (99%)
**Use Case:** All scanning and analysis skills

```markdown
## Early Exit Strategy

**Phase 1: Quick Scan (200 tokens)**
```bash
# Grep for obvious issues
MATCHES=$(Grep pattern="security-issue-pattern" head_limit=1)

if [ -z "$MATCHES" ]; then
    echo "✓ No issues detected"
    exit 0  # Total: 200 tokens
fi
```

**Phase 2: Deep Analysis (if issues found)**

```bash
# Only run if Phase 1 found issues (additional 2,000 tokens)
# Total when issues found: 2,200 tokens
```

**Savings:**

- No issues: 200 tokens (90% savings vs always running full analysis)
- Issues found: 2,200 tokens (normal cost)
- Average (assuming 50% clean runs): 60% savings

```

---

### Pattern 4: Progressive Disclosure
**Savings:** 60-85%
**Applicability:** 78 skills (79%)
**Use Case:** All reporting and scanning skills

```markdown
## Progressive Disclosure Strategy

**Level 1: Critical Issues Only (default)**
- Show full details for Critical issues only
- Summarize High issues
- Count Medium/Low issues
- **Output:** 2,000 tokens

**Level 2: High Issues (--verbose)**
- Show details for Critical + High
- Summarize Medium
- Count Low
- **Output:** 5,000 tokens

**Level 3: All Issues (--verbose --all)**
- Show details for all issues
- **Output:** 15,000 tokens

**Default Behavior:** Level 1 (87% savings vs Level 3)
```

---

### Pattern 5: Appropriate Tool Selection

**Savings:** Varies (30-90%)
**Applicability:** All 99 skills
**Use Case:** All tool usage decisions

```markdown
## Tool Selection Hierarchy

**Use Glob (50-100 tokens):**
- File structure discovery
- Count files by pattern
- Build target file list
- Example: `Glob pattern="**/*.test.ts"`

**Use Grep (100-500 tokens):**
- Pattern searches in files
- Filter files by content
- Quick validation
- Example: `Grep pattern="useEffect" type="ts" head_limit=20`

**Use Read (500-5,000 tokens per file):**
- Load specific matched files
- Get detailed context
- **ONLY after Grep filtering**
- Example: `Read src/components/Button.tsx`

**Use Task (3,500-50,000 tokens):**
- Complex multi-step workflows
- Extended reasoning required
- Specialized agent expertise
- **Use sparingly - last resort**
- Example: Multi-agent security review

**Rule:** Always use the cheapest tool that accomplishes the task
```

---

### Pattern 6: head_limit on All Searches

**Savings:** 80-95% on large codebases
**Applicability:** 85 skills (86%)
**Use Case:** All Grep and search operations

```markdown
## Search Result Limiting

**Anti-Pattern:**
```bash
# Returns unlimited results (potentially 10,000+ tokens)
Grep pattern="TODO" type="js"
```

**Optimized Pattern:**

```bash
# Limit to actionable results (500 tokens)
Grep pattern="TODO" type="js" head_limit=20
```

**Rationale:**

- Users can't action 1,000+ TODOs
- First 20 results are sufficient
- Provide flag for more: `--limit 100`

**Savings:** 80-95% on large codebases

```

---

### Pattern 7: Focus Areas / Scope Limiting
**Savings:** 70-90% on focused runs
**Applicability:** 90 skills (91%)
**Use Case:** All project-wide analysis skills

```markdown
## Scope Limiting Strategy

**Default: Changed Files Only**
```bash
# Analyze only git diff (modified files)
FILES=$(git diff --name-only HEAD)
# Typical: 2-5 files = 1,000 tokens
```

**Optional: Specific Path**

```bash
/security-scan src/auth
# Analyze only auth directory = 2,000 tokens
```

**Flag: Full Project**

```bash
/security-scan --full
# Analyze entire project = 10,000 tokens
```

**Savings:**

- Default (git diff): 1,000 tokens (90% savings)
- Specific path: 2,000 tokens (80% savings)
- Full scan: 10,000 tokens (baseline)

```

---

### Pattern 8: State File Architecture
**Savings:** 70-95%
**Applicability:** Session-based skills (15 skills)
**Use Case:** Multi-session workflows, incremental processing

```markdown
## State File Strategy

**State Location:** `.claude/sessions/[skill-name]/state.json`

**State Contents:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-01-26T10:30:00Z",
  "progress": {
    "phase": "implementation",
    "completed_tasks": ["task1", "task2"],
    "pending_tasks": ["task3", "task4"]
  },
  "context": {
    "files_analyzed": ["src/a.ts", "src/b.ts"],
    "issues_found": 5,
    "issues_fixed": 3
  }
}
```

**Usage:**

- Load state at start (50 tokens)
- Resume from last checkpoint
- Avoid re-analyzing completed work
- Save state incrementally

**Savings:** 70-95% on resumed sessions

```

### Monitoring Approach

#### Per-Skill Validation

For each optimized skill, validate:

1. **Token Usage:**
   - [ ] Measured on small project (< 20 files)
   - [ ] Measured on medium project (50-100 files)
   - [ ] Measured on large project (500+ files)
   - [ ] Savings documented in SKILL.md

2. **Functionality:**
   - [ ] All features working
   - [ ] Edge cases handled
   - [ ] No accuracy loss
   - [ ] User experience maintained or improved

3. **Caching:**
   - [ ] Cache creation verified
   - [ ] Cache hit behavior verified
   - [ ] Cache invalidation working
   - [ ] Shared cache integration tested

4. **Early Exit:**
   - [ ] Triggers on no issues found
   - [ ] Continues when issues exist
   - [ ] User flags respected (--full)

5. **Progressive Disclosure:**
   - [ ] Default output concise
   - [ ] --verbose provides more detail
   - [ ] --all shows everything
   - [ ] Tiered output saves tokens
