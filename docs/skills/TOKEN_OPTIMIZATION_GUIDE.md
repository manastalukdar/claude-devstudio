## Token Economics

### Understanding Token Costs

**Claude Code CLI Token Pricing (Sonnet 4.5):**
- Input tokens: $0.003 per 1K tokens
- Output tokens: $0.015 per 1K tokens
- Cache reads: $0.0003 per 1K tokens (90% discount)
- Cache writes: $0.00375 per 1K tokens

**Cost Comparison Examples:**

| Operation                    | Tokens  | Cost   | Optimized | Savings      |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------ |
| Read 50 files (unoptimized)  | 50,000  | $0.15  | 5,000     | 90% ($0.135) |
| Pattern search (Read all)    | 30,000  | $0.09  | 500       | 98% ($0.088) |
| Project analysis (full scan) | 100,000 | $0.30  | 15,000    | 85% ($0.255) |
| Code review (all files)      | 75,000  | $0.225 | 10,000    | 87% ($0.195) |

**Annual Impact for Active Developer:**
- Unoptimized: ~500K tokens/day × 250 days = 125M tokens/year = **$375/year**
- Optimized: ~75K tokens/day × 250 days = 18.75M tokens/year = **$56/year**
- **Savings: $319/year per developer (85% reduction)**

## Core Optimization Principles

### 1. Lazy Loading Principle

**Definition:** Only load information when absolutely necessary, in the minimum quantity required.

**Before (❌ Eager Loading):**
```markdown
# Bad: Load everything upfront
1. Read all TypeScript files
2. Read all test files
3. Read all config files
4. Read package.json
5. Read tsconfig.json
6. Then decide what to analyze

Token cost: 50,000+ tokens
```

**After (✅ Lazy Loading):**
```markdown
# Good: Load progressively as needed
1. Glob to find TypeScript files (50 tokens)
2. Grep for specific pattern (200 tokens)
3. Read ONLY matched files (2,000 tokens)
4. If needed, read config (500 tokens)

Token cost: 2,750 tokens (94% savings)
```

**Implementation Pattern:**
```markdown
<think>
What's the minimum information needed to make the next decision?
- Don't read files to "get context" - use Grep to find relevance first
- Don't load entire files - use offset/limit for large files
- Don't analyze everything - stop after finding N issues
</think>

Step 1: Discover (Glob) - Cheapest
Step 2: Filter (Grep) - Cheap
Step 3: Load (Read) - Expensive, do last
Step 4: Analyze - Work with what you have
```

### 2. Progressive Disclosure Principle

**Definition:** Start with shallow analysis, go deep only when findings warrant it.

**Three-Level Analysis Pattern:**

```markdown
Level 1 - Surface Scan (500-1,000 tokens):
- Glob for file structure
- Grep for obvious patterns
- Quick assessment: "Is there anything here?"
- Decision: Stop early or continue?

Level 2 - Targeted Analysis (2,000-5,000 tokens):
- Read files with matches
- Analyze specific issues found
- Generate focused recommendations
- Decision: Deep dive needed?

Level 3 - Deep Investigation (10,000+ tokens):
- Extended thinking for complex issues
- Multi-file correlation analysis
- Root cause investigation
- Comprehensive solutions
```

**Example - Security Scan:**
```markdown
# Level 1: Quick scan (500 tokens)
Grep "eval|exec|dangerouslySetInnerHTML" output_mode="files_with_matches"
→ Found 3 files with potential issues

# Level 2: Investigate matches (2,000 tokens)
Read the 3 matched files
→ Confirmed 2 security vulnerabilities

# Level 3: Deep analysis (5,000 tokens, only if critical)
If critical vulnerabilities found:
- Read surrounding context
- Analyze data flow
- Propose comprehensive fix
→ Otherwise, report findings from Level 2

Total: 2,500 tokens (vs. 30,000 for full codebase scan)
```

### 3. Context Minimization Principle

**Definition:** Keep the smallest possible context window for each operation.

**Context Window Management:**

```markdown
❌ BAD - Large Context Window:
- Load all 50 project files into context
- Keep entire conversation history
- Include all tool results
→ 100,000 token context window

✅ GOOD - Minimal Context Window:
- Load only files being modified
- Summarize previous findings
- Use state files to persist information
→ 5,000 token context window
```

**State Persistence Pattern:**
```bash
# Store analysis results for reuse
mkdir -p .claude/skill-name
cat > .claude/skill-name/state.json <<EOF
{
  "analyzed_files": ["src/file1.ts", "src/file2.ts"],
  "findings": [
    {"file": "src/file1.ts", "issue": "security vulnerability", "line": 45}
  ],
  "timestamp": "2026-01-25T10:30:00Z",
  "file_checksums": {
    "src/file1.ts": "abc123...",
    "src/file2.ts": "def456..."
  }
}
EOF
```

### 4. Caching & Reuse Principle

**Definition:** Never recompute what you've already computed. Cache and reuse.

**Three Caching Strategies:**

**A. State File Caching:**
```bash
# Check cache first
if [ -f .claude/security-scan/state.json ]; then
    CACHED_STATE=$(cat .claude/security-scan/state.json)
    CACHED_TIMESTAMP=$(echo "$CACHED_STATE" | jq -r '.timestamp')

    # Check if cache is recent (< 1 hour old)
    if [ $(($(date +%s) - $(date -d "$CACHED_TIMESTAMP" +%s))) -lt 3600 ]; then
        echo "Using cached analysis from $CACHED_TIMESTAMP"
        echo "$CACHED_STATE" | jq '.findings'
        exit 0
    fi
fi

# Otherwise, perform fresh analysis
# ... and cache results
```

**B. Cross-Skill Shared Cache:**
```bash
# Multiple skills share project analysis
# .claude/project-analysis/cache.json contains:
{
  "file_structure": [...],
  "dependencies": [...],
  "test_files": [...],
  "config_files": [...]
}

# Skills that use shared cache:
# - /security-scan
# - /review
# - /predict-issues
# - /understand
```

**C. Incremental Updates:**
```bash
# Only re-analyze changed files
PREVIOUS_CHECKSUMS=$(cat .claude/skill-name/checksums.json)
CURRENT_CHECKSUMS=$(find src -type f -exec sha256sum {} \; | jq -Rs 'split("\n")')

# Compare and find changed files
CHANGED_FILES=$(comm -13 <(echo "$PREVIOUS_CHECKSUMS") <(echo "$CURRENT_CHECKSUMS"))

# Only process changed files
if [ -z "$CHANGED_FILES" ]; then
    echo "No changes detected, using cached results"
    cat .claude/skill-name/state.json
fi
```

### 5. Early Exit Principle

**Definition:** Stop processing as soon as the goal is achieved. Don't be thorough for thoroughness' sake.

**Early Exit Patterns:**

```markdown
Pattern 1 - Found Enough Examples:
Grep "TODO" head_limit=5
→ Found 5 TODOs, that's enough to report on
→ Don't search for all TODOs if 5 examples suffice

Pattern 2 - Critical Issue Found:
Scanning for security issues...
→ Found SQL injection vulnerability
→ Stop, report immediately, don't scan further

Pattern 3 - Confidence Threshold Met:
Detecting project framework...
→ Found package.json with "react" dependency
→ Found src/App.tsx
→ Confidence: 100%, it's React
→ Stop, don't analyze further

Pattern 4 - Resource Limit Reached:
Grep "pattern" head_limit=100
→ Found 100 matches
→ Report: "Found 100+ matches (stopped at limit)"
→ Don't continue searching
```

**Implementation:**
```markdown
# Set clear stopping conditions
<think>
When should I stop processing?
- After finding N examples (N=5 usually sufficient)
- When confidence reaches 95%+
- When critical issue found
- When resource limit reached (files, tokens, time)
</think>

# Use head_limit aggressively
Grep "pattern" head_limit=20  # Not unlimited

# Add conditional logic
if [ $FINDINGS_COUNT -ge 5 ]; then
    echo "Found sufficient examples, stopping analysis"
    exit 0
fi
```

## Tool Selection Strategy

### Decision Tree for Tool Selection

```
Need to interact with files/code?
│
├─ Finding files by name/pattern?
│  └─> Use GLOB (cheapest: ~50 tokens)
│      Example: Glob "**/*.test.ts"
│      Returns: List of file paths
│
├─ Finding content/patterns in files?
│  └─> Use GREP (cheap: ~100-500 tokens)
│      │
│      ├─ Just need to know which files have pattern?
│      │  └─> Grep with output_mode="files_with_matches"
│      │      Example: Grep "TODO" output_mode="files_with_matches"
│      │      Returns: ["file1.ts", "file2.ts"]
│      │
│      ├─ Need match counts?
│      │  └─> Grep with output_mode="count"
│      │      Example: Grep "TODO" output_mode="count"
│      │      Returns: {"file1.ts": 5, "file2.ts": 12}
│      │
│      └─ Need actual content?
│         └─> Grep with output_mode="content" head_limit=20
│             Example: Grep "TODO" output_mode="content" head_limit=20
│             Returns: First 20 matching lines with context
│
├─ Need full file content?
│  └─> Use READ (expensive: ~500-10,000 tokens per file)
│      │
│      ├─ File is large (>500 lines)?
│      │  └─> Read with offset/limit
│      │      Example: Read file.ts offset=0 limit=100
│      │      Read only relevant sections
│      │
│      └─ File is small (<500 lines)?
│         └─> Read entire file
│             Example: Read config.json
│
├─ Need to run command/get system info?
│  └─> Use BASH (variable: ~50-5,000 tokens)
│      Example: git status, npm test, ls -la
│      Consider output size
│
└─ Complex multi-step workflow with reasoning?
   └─> Use TASK (expensive: ~1,000+ tokens overhead)
       Only when:
       - Requires extended thinking
       - Multiple coordinated operations
       - Specialized sub-agent expertise
       - Can't be done with direct tools
```

### Tool Efficiency Comparison

**Scenario: Find all test files with a specific pattern**

| Approach  | Tools Used                            | Tokens | Time      | Result Quality |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- | ------ | --------- | -------------- |
| **Worst** | Read all files, search manually       | 50,000 | Slow      | Complete       |
| **Bad**   | Task agent to search                  | 5,000  | Medium    | Complete       |
| **Good**  | Glob + Read matched files             | 3,000  | Fast      | Complete       |
| **Best**  | Glob + Grep files_with_matches + Read | 500    | Very Fast | Complete       |

**Token Breakdown - Best Approach:**
```markdown
1. Glob "**/*.test.ts" → 50 tokens (returns 20 file paths)
2. Grep "specific pattern" glob="**/*.test.ts" output_mode="files_with_matches"
   → 100 tokens (returns 3 matching files)
3. Read the 3 matched files → 1,500 tokens (500 each)
4. Analysis in conversation → 500 tokens

Total: 2,150 tokens vs. 50,000 (96% savings)
```

### Tool-Specific Optimization Guidelines

#### Glob Tool - File Discovery

**Best Practices:**
```markdown
✅ DO:
- Use for file discovery by pattern
- Use to understand project structure
- Use before Read to verify files exist
- Use with specific patterns to narrow results

❌ DON'T:
- Use to read file contents (use Read)
- Use to search within files (use Grep)
- Use overly broad patterns that return hundreds of files
```

**Examples:**
```markdown
# Efficient Glob patterns
Glob "**/*.test.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}"  # Specific extensions
Glob "src/components/**/*.tsx"     # Specific directory
Glob "**/package.json"             # Specific filename

# Inefficient Glob patterns (too broad)
Glob "**/*"                        # Returns everything
Glob "*.ts"                        # Misses nested files
```

**Token Cost:** ~10-100 tokens depending on result size
**When to Use:** Always, before Read operations
**Output:** File paths only (very compact)

#### Grep Tool - Content Search

**Best Practices:**
```markdown
✅ DO:
- Use output_mode="files_with_matches" for discovery
- Use head_limit to cap results
- Use specific regex patterns
- Use -i for case-insensitive when appropriate
- Use glob parameter to narrow search scope

❌ DON'T:
- Use output_mode="content" when you only need filenames
- Search without head_limit (can return thousands of matches)
- Use overly broad patterns (like ".*")
- Use when you know the exact file (just Read it)
```

**Output Modes Comparison:**

| Mode                 | Returns               | Token Cost | Use When                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| `files_with_matches` | File paths            | 50-200     | Finding which files have pattern |
| `count`              | Match counts per file | 100-300    | Statistics/metrics needed        |
| `content`            | Matching lines        | 500-5,000+ | Need actual code/text            |

**Examples:**
```markdown
# Discovery phase - cheapest
Grep "TODO" output_mode="files_with_matches"
→ ["src/app.ts", "src/utils.ts"]
→ ~100 tokens

# Metrics phase - cheap
Grep "TODO" output_mode="count"
→ {"src/app.ts": 5, "src/utils.ts": 12}
→ ~150 tokens

# Content phase - expensive
Grep "TODO" output_mode="content" head_limit=10
→ 10 matching lines with context
→ ~1,000 tokens

# Optimized with context window (-A, -B, -C)
Grep "function authenticate" output_mode="content" -A=5 -B=2
→ Matching line + 5 lines after + 2 lines before
→ Minimal context, not entire file
```

**Token Cost:** 50-5,000 tokens depending on mode and matches
**When to Use:** Content discovery, pattern matching, before Read
**Output:** Configurable - paths, counts, or content

#### Read Tool - File Contents

**Best Practices:**
```markdown
✅ DO:
- Read only files you know you need
- Use offset/limit for large files
- Use after Grep to verify you need the content
- Batch reads when analyzing multiple related files

❌ DON'T:
- Read speculatively ("let me read this just in case")
- Read entire large files (use offset/limit)
- Read the same file multiple times (cache in context)
- Read files to "understand the codebase" (use Grep/Glob)
```

**Large File Strategies:**

```markdown
Strategy 1 - Offset/Limit Pagination:
Read large.ts offset=0 limit=100    # First 100 lines
# Analyze, determine if you need more
Read large.ts offset=100 limit=100  # Next 100 lines

Strategy 2 - Grep First, Read Precisely:
Grep "targetFunction" path="large.ts" output_mode="content" -A=20
# Gets just the function with 20 lines context
# Much cheaper than reading entire file

Strategy 3 - Multiple Small Reads:
# If you need specific sections
Read large.ts offset=0 limit=50     # Imports section
Read large.ts offset=200 limit=30   # Specific function
# Skip irrelevant middle sections
```

**File Size Guidelines:**

| File Size      | Strategy                              | Token Cost  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| < 200 lines    | Read entire file                      | 500-1,000   |
| 200-500 lines  | Read entire, acceptable               | 1,000-2,500 |
| 500-1000 lines | Consider offset/limit or Grep first   | 2,500-5,000 |
| 1000+ lines    | Always use Grep first or offset/limit | 5,000+      |

**Token Cost:** 500-10,000+ tokens depending on file size
**When to Use:** After verifying file is needed via Grep/Glob
**Output:** Full file content (largest token consumer)

#### Bash Tool - Command Execution

**Best Practices:**
```markdown
✅ DO:
- Use for git operations
- Use for package manager commands
- Use for system information (ls, pwd, etc.)
- Use for quick file checks (test -f, wc -l)
- Capture output efficiently

❌ DON'T:
- Use for file content reading (use Read)
- Use for pattern searching (use Grep)
- Use for complex file operations (use specialized tools)
- Execute commands with massive output without limiting
```

**Efficient Bash Patterns:**

```markdown
# File existence check (minimal tokens)
if [ -f .claude/cache/state.json ]; then
    echo "Cache exists"
fi

# Count files without reading
ls src/**/*.ts | wc -l

# Quick file statistics
wc -l src/main.ts  # Line count only

# Limit output
git log --oneline -10  # Not entire history

# Pipe to head for large output
npm list | head -20
```

**Token Cost:** 50-5,000 tokens depending on command output
**When to Use:** System operations, git, package managers
**Output:** Command stdout/stderr

#### Task Tool - Sub-Agents

**Best Practices:**
```markdown
✅ DO Use Task When:
- Complex multi-step workflow with decision points
- Need extended thinking (security analysis, architecture review)
- Coordinating multiple tools with reasoning
- Specialized expertise required (Performance agent, Security agent)
- Parallel processing of independent operations

❌ DON'T Use Task When:
- Simple Grep would work
- Just reading a file
- Running a single command
- Simple pattern matching
- Basic file operations
```

**Task vs. Direct Tools Decision Matrix:**

| Scenario                           | Use Task? | Better Alternative           |
| ---------------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------- |
| Find all TODOs                     | ❌ No      | Grep "TODO"                  |
| Read config file                   | ❌ No      | Read config.json             |
| Security vulnerability analysis    | ✅ Yes     | Task with security agent     |
| Find which files import X          | ❌ No      | Grep "import.*X"             |
| Architecture review                | ✅ Yes     | Task with architecture agent |
| Run tests                          | ❌ No      | Bash "npm test"              |
| Root cause analysis of complex bug | ✅ Yes     | Task with debugging agent    |
| Count files in directory           | ❌ No      | Bash "ls \| wc -l"           |

**Token Overhead:**
- Agent spawn: ~500-1,000 tokens
- Agent context: ~1,000-5,000 tokens
- Agent reasoning: ~2,000-10,000 tokens
- **Total overhead: 3,500-16,000 tokens**

**When Justified:**
- Value of analysis > overhead cost
- Can't be done with simple tools
- Requires specialized reasoning
- Time saved > token cost

**Token Cost:** 3,500-50,000+ tokens (high overhead)
**When to Use:** Complex analysis requiring extended thinking
**Output:** Comprehensive analysis, recommendations

    "invalidate_on": ["src/**/*.ts"]
  }
}
```

**Cache Validation Logic:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function to check if cache is valid
is_cache_valid() {
    local state_file=".claude/security-scan/state.json"

    # Check if state file exists
    if [ ! -f "$state_file" ]; then
        return 1  # Cache doesn't exist
    fi

    # Check if cache has expired (TTL)
    local expires_at=$(jq -r '.cache_metadata.expires_at' "$state_file")
    local now=$(date -u +%s)
    local expires_timestamp=$(date -d "$expires_at" +%s)

    if [ $now -gt $expires_timestamp ]; then
        return 1  # Cache expired
    fi

    # Check if any tracked files have changed
    local files_changed=0
    while IFS= read -r file; do
        local cached_checksum=$(jq -r ".file_metadata[\"$file\"].checksum" "$state_file")
        local current_checksum=$(sha256sum "$file" | awk '{print $1}')

        if [ "$cached_checksum" != "sha256:$current_checksum" ]; then
            files_changed=1
            break
        fi
    done < <(jq -r '.file_metadata | keys[]' "$state_file")

    if [ $files_changed -eq 1 ]; then
        return 1  # Files changed, cache invalid
    fi

    return 0  # Cache is valid
}

# Usage in skill
if is_cache_valid; then
    echo "Using cached analysis results"
    cat .claude/security-scan/state.json | jq '.analysis_results'
    exit 0
else
    echo "Cache invalid or expired, performing fresh analysis"
    # ... perform analysis
    # ... save new state
fi
```

**Incremental Updates:**

```bash
# Only re-analyze changed files
update_incremental_cache() {
    local state_file=".claude/security-scan/state.json"
    local changed_files=()

    # Find changed files
    while IFS= read -r file; do
        local cached_checksum=$(jq -r ".file_metadata[\"$file\"].checksum" "$state_file")
        local current_checksum=$(sha256sum "$file" | awk '{print $1}')

        if [ "$cached_checksum" != "sha256:$current_checksum" ]; then
            changed_files+=("$file")
        fi
    done < <(jq -r '.file_metadata | keys[]' "$state_file")

    # Re-analyze only changed files
    for file in "${changed_files[@]}"; do
        echo "Re-analyzing changed file: $file"
        analyze_file "$file"  # Your analysis function

        # Update checksum in state
        local new_checksum=$(sha256sum "$file" | awk '{print $1}')
        jq ".file_metadata[\"$file\"].checksum = \"sha256:$new_checksum\"" "$state_file" > tmp.json
        mv tmp.json "$state_file"
    done

    echo "Incremental update complete. Re-analyzed ${#changed_files[@]} files."
}
```

**Token Savings:**
- Initial run: 15,000 tokens (full analysis)
- Subsequent runs with cache: 500 tokens (cache read + validation)
- Incremental update: 2,000 tokens (only changed files)
- **Savings: 87-97% on subsequent runs**

### 2. Shared Analysis Cache

**Purpose:** Multiple skills share common project analysis to avoid duplicate work.

**Shared Cache Structure:**

```json
// .claude/project-analysis/cache.json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "last_updated": "2026-01-25T10:00:00Z",
  "project_root": "/path/to/project",

  "project_structure": {
    "framework": "Next.js",
    "language": "TypeScript",
    "package_manager": "npm",
    "test_framework": "Jest",
    "build_tool": "Webpack"
  },

  "file_discovery": {
    "all_source_files": ["src/app.ts", "src/auth.ts", ...],
    "test_files": ["src/app.test.ts", "src/auth.test.ts", ...],
    "config_files": ["package.json", "tsconfig.json", ...],
    "total_files": 150,
    "total_lines": 25000
  },

  "dependencies": {
    "production": ["react", "next", ...],
    "development": ["jest", "typescript", ...],
    "total": 50
  },

  "code_patterns": {
    "imports": {
      "react": 25,
      "lodash": 8,
      "internal": 150
    },
    "exports": {
      "named": 45,
      "default": 20
    }
  },

  "metrics": {
    "files_by_extension": {
      ".ts": 80,
      ".tsx": 40,
      ".json": 5
    },
    "avg_file_size": 167,
    "largest_file": "src/components/Dashboard.tsx",
    "largest_file_lines": 1250
  }
}
```

**Skills Using Shared Cache:**

```bash
# /security-scan skill
if [ -f .claude/project-analysis/cache.json ]; then
    FRAMEWORK=$(jq -r '.project_structure.framework' .claude/project-analysis/cache.json)
    SOURCE_FILES=$(jq -r '.file_discovery.all_source_files[]' .claude/project-analysis/cache.json)

    echo "Using cached project structure (Framework: $FRAMEWORK)"
    echo "Scanning ${SOURCE_FILES} files for vulnerabilities"
else
    echo "No project cache found. Run /analyze-project first for better performance."
fi

# /review skill
if [ -f .claude/project-analysis/cache.json ]; then
    TEST_FILES=$(jq -r '.file_discovery.test_files[]' .claude/project-analysis/cache.json)
    TEST_FRAMEWORK=$(jq -r '.project_structure.test_framework' .claude/project-analysis/cache.json)

    echo "Using cached test file list (${#TEST_FILES[@]} files)"
    echo "Test framework: $TEST_FRAMEWORK"
fi

# /understand skill
if [ -f .claude/project-analysis/cache.json ]; then
    # Use cached analysis instead of re-analyzing
    cat .claude/project-analysis/cache.json | jq '.project_structure'
    exit 0
fi
```

**Cache Generation Skill:**

```markdown
# /analyze-project skill (new)
I'll perform a comprehensive project analysis and cache the results for other skills.

This is a one-time analysis that benefits multiple skills:
- /security-scan
- /review
- /predict-issues
- /understand
- /refactor

```bash
# Create cache directory
mkdir -p .claude/project-analysis

# Discover project structure (efficient with Glob/Grep)
echo "Analyzing project structure..."

# Step 1: File discovery (Glob - cheap)
ALL_SOURCE=$(find src -type f \( -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.jsx" \) | jq -R -s -c 'split("\n")[:-1]')
TEST_FILES=$(find . -type f -name "*.test.*" | jq -R -s -c 'split("\n")[:-1]')
CONFIG_FILES=$(ls *.json *.config.* 2>/dev/null | jq -R -s -c 'split("\n")[:-1]')

# Step 2: Framework detection (Grep - cheap)
if grep -q "\"next\"" package.json; then
    FRAMEWORK="Next.js"
elif grep -q "\"react\"" package.json; then
    FRAMEWORK="React"
fi

# Step 3: Generate cache
cat > .claude/project-analysis/cache.json <<EOF
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "last_updated": "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)",
  "project_structure": {
    "framework": "$FRAMEWORK",
    "language": "TypeScript"
  },
  "file_discovery": {
    "all_source_files": $ALL_SOURCE,
    "test_files": $TEST_FILES,
    "config_files": $CONFIG_FILES
  }
}
EOF

echo "✓ Project analysis cached in .claude/project-analysis/cache.json"
echo "Other skills will now run 60-80% faster"
```
```

**Token Savings Across Skills:**

| Skill                | Without Shared Cache | With Shared Cache | Savings |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- | ------- |
| /security-scan       | 15,000 tokens        | 5,000 tokens      | 67%     |
| /review              | 12,000 tokens        | 4,000 tokens      | 67%     |
| /predict-issues      | 18,000 tokens        | 6,000 tokens      | 67%     |
| /understand          | 10,000 tokens        | 2,000 tokens      | 80%     |
| **Total (4 skills)** | **55,000 tokens**    | **17,000 tokens** | **69%** |

### 3. Smart Pagination & Chunking

**Purpose:** Process large datasets in manageable chunks, stopping when sufficient information is gathered.

**Pattern 1 - Iterative Pagination:**

```markdown
# Find security issues, stop after finding 10
```bash
FINDINGS=0
OFFSET=0
LIMIT=20

while [ $FINDINGS -lt 10 ]; do
    # Search in batches
    MATCHES=$(Grep "eval|exec" output_mode="files_with_matches" offset=$OFFSET head_limit=$LIMIT)

    if [ -z "$MATCHES" ]; then
        echo "No more files to check"
        break
    fi

    # Analyze this batch
    for file in $MATCHES; do
        # Check if file has actual vulnerability
        RESULT=$(analyze_file "$file")
        if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
            FINDINGS=$((FINDINGS + 1))
            echo "Found vulnerability in $file"

            if [ $FINDINGS -ge 10 ]; then
                echo "Found 10 vulnerabilities, stopping analysis"
                break 2  # Exit both loops
            fi
        fi
    done

    OFFSET=$((OFFSET + LIMIT))
done
```
```

**Pattern 2 - Adaptive Chunk Sizing:**

```bash
# Start with small chunks, increase if no issues found
analyze_with_adaptive_chunks() {
    local chunk_size=10
    local max_chunk_size=100
    local offset=0
    local issues_found=0

    while true; do
        # Get next chunk
        files=$(Glob "src/**/*.ts" | tail -n +$((offset + 1)) | head -n $chunk_size)

        if [ -z "$files" ]; then
            break  # No more files
        fi

        # Analyze chunk
        chunk_issues=$(analyze_files "$files")
        issues_found=$((issues_found + chunk_issues))

        # Adaptive logic: if no issues, increase chunk size
        if [ $chunk_issues -eq 0 ] && [ $chunk_size -lt $max_chunk_size ]; then
            chunk_size=$((chunk_size * 2))
            echo "No issues in chunk, doubling chunk size to $chunk_size"
        fi

        # If many issues, decrease chunk size for precision
        if [ $chunk_issues -gt 5 ]; then
            chunk_size=$((chunk_size / 2))
            echo "Many issues found, halving chunk size to $chunk_size"
        fi

        offset=$((offset + chunk_size))
    done

    echo "Total issues found: $issues_found"
}
```

**Pattern 3 - Confidence-Based Early Exit:**

```markdown
# Framework detection with confidence tracking
```bash
detect_framework_with_confidence() {
    local confidence=0
    local framework=""

    # Level 1: Check package.json (fast)
    if grep -q "\"next\"" package.json; then
        framework="Next.js"
        confidence=60
    fi

    if [ $confidence -ge 95 ]; then
        echo "$framework (confidence: $confidence%)"
        return 0
    fi

    # Level 2: Check for framework-specific files
    if [ -f "next.config.js" ]; then
        confidence=$((confidence + 25))
    fi

    if [ $confidence -ge 95 ]; then
        echo "$framework (confidence: $confidence%)"
        return 0
    fi

    # Level 3: Check imports (more expensive)
    if Grep "from 'next'" output_mode="count" | head -1 | grep -q "[5-9]"; then
        confidence=$((confidence + 15))
    fi

    echo "$framework (confidence: $confidence%)"
}
```
```

**Token Savings:**
- Processing all files: 20,000 tokens
- Paginated with early exit: 3,000 tokens
- **Savings: 85%**

### 4. Grep Output Mode Optimization

**Comprehensive Guide to Grep Output Modes:**

**Mode 1: files_with_matches (Cheapest)**

```bash
# Use when: You only need to know WHICH files have the pattern
Grep "TODO" output_mode="files_with_matches"

# Returns:
# src/app.ts
# src/utils.ts
# src/auth.ts

# Token cost: ~100 tokens
# Use cases:
# - File discovery before Read
# - Counting files with pattern
# - Building file list for batch processing
```

**Mode 2: count (Cheap)**

```bash
# Use when: You need statistics/metrics
Grep "TODO" output_mode="count"

# Returns (JSON):
# {
#   "src/app.ts": 5,
#   "src/utils.ts": 12,
#   "src/auth.ts": 3
# }

# Token cost: ~200 tokens
# Use cases:
# - Metrics and reporting
# - Prioritizing files by issue count
# - Dashboard/summary generation
```

**Mode 3: content (Most Expensive)**

```bash
# Use when: You need actual code/text
Grep "TODO" output_mode="content" head_limit=10

# Returns:
# src/app.ts:45:  // TODO: Add error handling
# src/app.ts:67:  // TODO: Refactor this function
# src/utils.ts:12:  // TODO: Add tests
# ... (up to 10 matches)

# Token cost: ~2,000 tokens (depends on matches and context)
# Use cases:
# - Generating specific recommendations
# - Code analysis requiring actual code
# - Final reporting with examples
```

**Optimization Strategy - Three-Phase Search:**

```markdown
Phase 1 - Discovery (files_with_matches):
```bash
FILES=$(Grep "security.*vulnerability" output_mode="files_with_matches")
echo "Found pattern in: $FILES"
# Token cost: 100 tokens
```

Phase 2 - Prioritization (count):
```bash
COUNTS=$(Grep "security.*vulnerability" output_mode="count")
HIGH_PRIORITY=$(echo "$COUNTS" | jq 'to_entries | sort_by(.value) | reverse | .[0:5] | from_entries')
echo "Files with most matches: $HIGH_PRIORITY"
# Token cost: 200 tokens
```

Phase 3 - Analysis (content, targeted):
```bash
# Only get content for high-priority files
for file in $(echo "$HIGH_PRIORITY" | jq -r 'keys[]'); do
    Grep "security.*vulnerability" path="$file" output_mode="content" head_limit=5
done
# Token cost: 1,000 tokens (5 files × 5 matches × ~40 tokens each)
```

Total: 1,300 tokens vs. 10,000 tokens for reading all files
```

### 5. Context Window Optimization

**Purpose:** Minimize the size of context sent with each request.

**Technique 1 - Summarization:**

```markdown
# Instead of keeping full analysis in context
<previous-analysis>
File: src/auth.ts (1,500 tokens)
Full code here...
Analysis: Found 3 security issues...
Detailed analysis here...
Recommendations here...
</previous-analysis>

# Summarize to essentials
<previous-analysis-summary>
src/auth.ts: 3 security issues found (SQL injection, XSS, insecure crypto)
Recommendations saved in .claude/security-scan/findings.json
</previous-analysis-summary>

Token reduction: 1,500 → 50 tokens (97% savings)
```

**Technique 2 - Reference State Files:**

```markdown
# Instead of: "Previously, I found these 50 issues: [long list]"
# Use: "Previously, I found 50 issues (see .claude/security-scan/state.json)"

# In skill execution:
echo "Loading previous findings from state file..."
PREVIOUS_FINDINGS=$(cat .claude/security-scan/state.json | jq '.findings')
# Process without adding to context
```

**Technique 3 - Minimal File Reads:**

```markdown
# Bad: Read entire file to check one thing
Read package.json (500 tokens)
Check if "react" is in dependencies

# Good: Grep for specific check
Grep "\"react\"" path="package.json" output_mode="content"
Returns: "  \"react\": \"^18.0.0\""
Token cost: 50 tokens (90% savings)
```

## Skill Design Patterns

### Pattern 1: The Discovery-Filter-Load Pattern

**Purpose:** Three-phase approach to efficiently find and process relevant files.

**Implementation:**

```markdown
# Phase 1: DISCOVER - Use Glob (cheapest)
## Find all potentially relevant files
```bash
echo "Phase 1: Discovering files..."
POTENTIAL_FILES=$(Glob "**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}")
FILE_COUNT=$(echo "$POTENTIAL_FILES" | wc -l)
echo "Found $FILE_COUNT source files"
# Token cost: ~100 tokens
```

# Phase 2: FILTER - Use Grep (cheap)
## Narrow down to files that actually need analysis
```bash
echo "Phase 2: Filtering relevant files..."
RELEVANT_FILES=$(Grep "useState|useEffect" glob="**/*.{ts,tsx}" output_mode="files_with_matches")
RELEVANT_COUNT=$(echo "$RELEVANT_FILES" | wc -l)
echo "Filtered to $RELEVANT_COUNT files with React hooks"
# Token cost: ~300 tokens
```

# Phase 3: LOAD - Use Read (expensive)
## Only read the filtered files
```bash
echo "Phase 3: Loading relevant files..."
for file in $RELEVANT_FILES; do
    echo "Analyzing $file..."
    # Read file content
    # Perform analysis
done
# Token cost: ~5,000 tokens (for 10 files)
```

Total: ~5,400 tokens
Without optimization: ~50,000 tokens (reading all files)
Savings: 89%
```

**Use Cases:**
- Security scanning
- Code quality analysis
- Refactoring planning
- Architecture review

### Pattern 2: The Cached Analysis Pattern

**Purpose:** Avoid redundant analysis by caching results with intelligent invalidation.

**Implementation:**

```markdown
# Cache structure
```json
{
  "cache_metadata": {
    "created_at": "timestamp",
    "ttl_seconds": 3600,
    "version": "1.0",
    "invalidation_rules": {
      "file_changes": ["src/**/*.ts"],
      "config_changes": ["package.json", "tsconfig.json"]
    }
  },
  "analysis_data": { ... }
}
```

# Cache validation function
```bash
is_cache_valid() {
    # Check TTL
    # Check file modifications
    # Check config changes
    # Return 0 (valid) or 1 (invalid)
}

# Usage in skill
if is_cache_valid ".claude/skill-name/cache.json"; then
    echo "✓ Using cached analysis (saved ~10,000 tokens)"
    cat .claude/skill-name/cache.json | jq '.analysis_data'
    exit 0
else
    echo "Cache invalid, performing fresh analysis..."
    # Perform analysis
    # Save to cache
fi
```
```

**Use Cases:**
- Project structure analysis
- Dependency analysis
- Test coverage reports
- Documentation generation

### Pattern 3: The Progressive Disclosure Pattern

**Purpose:** Start shallow, go deep only when necessary.

**Implementation:**

```markdown
# Level 1: Quick Scan (500 tokens)
<think>
Is there anything obviously wrong?
- Quick Grep for known anti-patterns
- Check file structure with Glob
- Decision: Looks good or needs deeper analysis?
</think>

```bash
# Quick anti-pattern check
QUICK_ISSUES=$(Grep "eval\(|innerHTML|dangerouslySetInnerHTML" output_mode="count")
ISSUE_COUNT=$(echo "$QUICK_ISSUES" | jq '[.[] | select(. > 0)] | length')

if [ $ISSUE_COUNT -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "✓ No obvious issues found in quick scan"
    exit 0
fi

echo "Found $ISSUE_COUNT files with potential issues, proceeding to Level 2..."
```

# Level 2: Targeted Analysis (2,000 tokens)
<think>
Now I know WHERE the issues are. Analyze those specific files.
</think>

```bash
# Read only files with issues
for file in $(echo "$QUICK_ISSUES" | jq -r 'to_entries | .[] | select(.value > 0) | .key'); do
    echo "Analyzing $file..."
    # Read and analyze specific file
done

# If critical issues found, proceed to Level 3
if [ $CRITICAL_ISSUES -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "Critical issues found, proceeding to Level 3 deep analysis..."
fi
```

# Level 3: Deep Investigation (10,000 tokens) - Only if needed
<think>
Critical issues require comprehensive analysis:
- Data flow analysis
- Dependency tracing
- Impact assessment
- Comprehensive remediation plan
</think>

```bash
# Spawn specialized agent for deep analysis
# Use Task tool with security agent
# Extended thinking enabled
```
```

**Token Distribution:**
- 80% of cases: Level 1 (500 tokens)
- 15% of cases: Level 2 (2,000 tokens)
- 5% of cases: Level 3 (10,000 tokens)
- Average: 1,075 tokens vs. 10,000 tokens (89% savings)

### Pattern 4: The Incremental Processing Pattern

**Purpose:** Process large datasets incrementally, maintaining state between iterations.

**Implementation:**

```markdown
# State file tracks progress
```json
{
  "processed_files": ["src/file1.ts", "src/file2.ts"],
  "remaining_files": ["src/file3.ts", "src/file4.ts", ...],
  "current_batch": 2,
  "total_batches": 10,
  "findings": [...]
}
```

# Batch processing
```bash
BATCH_SIZE=10
STATE_FILE=".claude/refactor/state.json"

# Load state
if [ -f "$STATE_FILE" ]; then
    REMAINING=$(jq -r '.remaining_files[]' "$STATE_FILE")
    CURRENT_BATCH=$(jq -r '.current_batch' "$STATE_FILE")
else
    # First run: initialize
    REMAINING=$(Glob "src/**/*.ts")
    CURRENT_BATCH=0
fi

# Process next batch
BATCH=$(echo "$REMAINING" | head -n $BATCH_SIZE)

for file in $BATCH; do
    echo "Processing $file (batch $CURRENT_BATCH)..."
    # Process file
    # Update state
done

# Save progress
jq ".current_batch = $((CURRENT_BATCH + 1))" "$STATE_FILE" > tmp.json
mv tmp.json "$STATE_FILE"

echo "✓ Batch $CURRENT_BATCH complete. Resume with same command."
```
```

**Benefits:**
- Can pause/resume at any time
- Handles large codebases gracefully
- No single operation exceeds token limit
- Progress is always saved

### Pattern 5: The Smart Default Pattern

**Purpose:** Use intelligent defaults to avoid unnecessary analysis.

**Implementation:**

```markdown
# Instead of analyzing everything to detect framework:
```bash
detect_framework_smart() {
    # Default check order: fast → expensive

    # 1. Check package.json (fastest, 50 tokens)
    if [ -f "package.json" ]; then
        if grep -q "\"next\"" package.json; then
            echo "Next.js"; return 0
        elif grep -q "\"react\"" package.json; then
            echo "React"; return 0
        fi
    fi

    # 2. Check for framework-specific files (fast, 100 tokens)
    if [ -f "next.config.js" ]; then echo "Next.js"; return 0; fi
    if [ -f "vue.config.js" ]; then echo "Vue"; return 0; fi

    # 3. Only if still unclear, analyze imports (expensive, 1,000 tokens)
    FRAMEWORK=$(Grep "from ['\"]next|from ['\"]react|from ['\"]vue" output_mode="count" | jq -r 'to_entries | max_by(.value) | .key')
    echo "$FRAMEWORK"
}
```
```

**Smart Defaults Checklist:**
- ✅ Assume common conventions first (e.g., src/ for source code)
- ✅ Use file presence as strong signal (next.config.js = Next.js)
- ✅ Check cheapest sources first (package.json before code analysis)
- ✅ Accept "good enough" answers (80% confidence vs. 100%)
- ✅ Document assumptions for users to override if needed

---

## Implementation Guidelines

### For New Skills (Tier 1, 2, 3)

**1. Planning Phase - Token Budget:**

```markdown
Before writing skill, answer:
1. What's the minimum information needed? [List]
2. Which tools can get that information? [Glob/Grep/Read/Bash/Task]
3. What's the expected token budget? [Range]
4. Can results be cached? [Yes/No]
5. What's the early exit condition? [Condition]

Example - /api-test-generate:
1. Minimum info: API endpoint definitions, request/response schemas
2. Tools: Glob (find API files), Grep (find endpoints), Read (get schemas)
3. Token budget: 3,000-5,000 tokens
4. Cache: Yes, save generated tests template
5. Early exit: After generating tests for 10 endpoints (sufficient sample)
```

**2. Implementation Phase - Optimization First:**

```markdown
Structure your skill:

## Part 1: Quick Validation (100-200 tokens)
- Verify prerequisites exist
- Quick checks that might allow early exit
- Bash commands, file existence checks

## Part 2: Efficient Discovery (200-500 tokens)
- Glob for file structure
- Grep for patterns
- Build target file list

## Part 3: Targeted Loading (2,000-5,000 tokens)
- Read only necessary files
- Use offset/limit for large files
- Batch related reads

## Part 4: Analysis (1,000-3,000 tokens)
- Process loaded information
- Generate recommendations
- Save state for future runs

## Part 5: Output (500-1,000 tokens)
- Concise summary
- Reference state files for details
- Suggest next actions
```

**3. Testing Phase - Token Measurement:**

```bash
# Add token tracking to skill development
```markdown
# In skill documentation
**Token Budget:** 3,000-5,000 tokens
**Actual Usage:**
- Small project (10 files): ~2,500 tokens
- Medium project (50 files): ~4,200 tokens
- Large project (200 files): ~6,000 tokens (needs optimization)

**Optimization Status:** ✅ Optimized
**Last Reviewed:** 2026-01-25
```
```

### For Existing Skills - Optimization Audit

**Audit Checklist:**

```markdown
For each existing skill, check:

1. **File Reading Pattern:**
   - [ ] Uses Grep before Read?
   - [ ] Uses Glob for discovery?
   - [ ] Reads files speculatively? (❌ Bad)
   - [ ] Uses offset/limit for large files?

2. **Caching Strategy:**
   - [ ] Has state file implementation?
   - [ ] Checks cache validity?
   - [ ] Supports incremental updates?
   - [ ] Shares cache with other skills?

3. **Early Exit Conditions:**
   - [ ] Defines stopping conditions?
   - [ ] Uses head_limit on Grep?
   - [ ] Stops after N findings?
   - [ ] Has confidence thresholds?

4. **Tool Selection:**
   - [ ] Uses cheapest appropriate tool?
   - [ ] Avoids Task for simple operations?
   - [ ] Batches operations efficiently?
   - [ ] Minimizes Read operations?

5. **Context Management:**
   - [ ] Keeps minimal context?
   - [ ] References state files vs. re-explaining?
   - [ ] Summarizes previous findings?
   - [ ] Avoids redundant information?
```

**Priority Optimization Targets:**

```markdown
High Impact (Optimize First):
1. Skills that Read multiple files (e.g., /security-scan, /review)
2. Skills called frequently (e.g., /commit, /test)
3. Skills without caching (e.g., /predict-issues)
4. Skills using Task unnecessarily

Medium Impact:
1. Skills with verbose output
2. Skills analyzing large files
3. Skills without early exit

Low Impact:
1. Skills reading single small files
2. Skills called rarely
3. Simple utility skills
```

# Skill Title

I'll help you [accomplish task] efficiently.

**Token Optimization:**
- Uses cached analysis when available
- Processes files incrementally
- Early exit after [N] findings
- Expected tokens: [range]

<think>
Token optimization strategy:
1. Check cache first (500 tokens)
2. Use Glob/Grep for discovery (200 tokens)
3. Read only necessary files (2,000 tokens)
4. Early exit conditions: [list]
5. Save state for next run

Total budget: ~2,700 tokens vs. [X without optimization]
</think>

## Phase 1: Cache Check (500 tokens)

First, let me check if we have recent analysis:

```bash
# Check for cached state
if [ -f .claude/skill-name/state.json ]; then
    # Validate cache
    LAST_RUN=$(jq -r '.timestamp' .claude/skill-name/state.json)
    SECONDS_SINCE=$(($(date +%s) - $(date -d "$LAST_RUN" +%s)))

    # Cache valid if < 1 hour old
    if [ $SECONDS_SINCE -lt 3600 ]; then
        echo "✓ Using cached analysis from $(date -d "$LAST_RUN" '+%H:%M')"
        cat .claude/skill-name/state.json | jq '.results'
        exit 0
    fi
fi

echo "No valid cache found, performing fresh analysis..."
```

## Phase 2: Efficient Discovery (200 tokens)

```bash
# Use Glob for file discovery (cheap)
TARGET_FILES=$(Glob "**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}")
FILE_COUNT=$(echo "$TARGET_FILES" | wc -l)
echo "Discovered $FILE_COUNT potential files"

# Use Grep to filter (cheap)
RELEVANT_FILES=$(Grep "[pattern]" output_mode="files_with_matches" glob="**/*.{ts,tsx}")
RELEVANT_COUNT=$(echo "$RELEVANT_FILES" | wc -l)
echo "Filtered to $RELEVANT_COUNT relevant files"

# Early exit if nothing found
if [ $RELEVANT_COUNT -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "✓ No issues found"
    exit 0
fi
```

## Phase 3: Targeted Analysis (2,000 tokens)

```bash
# Only read files that matched pattern
FINDINGS=0
MAX_FINDINGS=10

for file in $RELEVANT_FILES; do
    if [ $FINDINGS -ge $MAX_FINDINGS ]; then
        echo "✓ Found $MAX_FINDINGS issues, stopping (sufficient sample)"
        break
    fi

    # Read and analyze file
    # ... analysis logic

    FINDINGS=$((FINDINGS + 1))
done
```

## Phase 4: Cache Results

```bash
# Save results for future runs
mkdir -p .claude/skill-name
cat > .claude/skill-name/state.json <<EOF
{
  "timestamp": "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)",
  "files_analyzed": $RELEVANT_COUNT,
  "findings": $FINDINGS,
  "results": [...]
}
EOF

echo "✓ Results cached for next run"
```

**Token Efficiency:**
- With cache: ~500 tokens
- Without cache: ~2,700 tokens
- Unoptimized version: ~15,000 tokens
- **Savings: 82-97%**
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Optimizing /security-scan

**Original Implementation (❌ Unoptimized):**

```markdown
# security-scan skill (BEFORE)

I'll scan your codebase for security vulnerabilities.

```bash
# Step 1: Read all source files
for file in $(find src -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx"); do
    echo "Reading $file..."
    # Read each file (50 files × 500 tokens = 25,000 tokens)
done

# Step 2: Read all config files
cat package.json       # 200 tokens
cat tsconfig.json      # 150 tokens
cat .env.example       # 100 tokens

# Step 3: Analyze everything
# Analyze all 50 files... (5,000 tokens)

# Step 4: Generate report
# Comprehensive report... (2,000 tokens)
```

**Total: ~32,000 tokens**
**Cost: $0.096 per run**
```

**Optimized Implementation (✅ Optimized):**

```markdown
# security-scan skill (AFTER)

I'll scan your codebase for security vulnerabilities efficiently.

<think>
Optimization strategy:
1. Check cache first (might avoid entire analysis)
2. Use Grep to find potential issues (not Read)
3. Only Read files that Grep identified
4. Use progressive disclosure (quick scan → deep analysis if needed)
5. Cache results for 1 hour
</think>

## Phase 1: Cache Check (100 tokens)

```bash
if [ -f .claude/security-scan/state.json ]; then
    LAST_SCAN=$(jq -r '.timestamp' .claude/security-scan/state.json)
    AGE_MINUTES=$(( ($(date +%s) - $(date -d "$LAST_SCAN" +%s)) / 60 ))

    if [ $AGE_MINUTES -lt 60 ]; then
        echo "✓ Using cached scan from $AGE_MINUTES minutes ago"
        cat .claude/security-scan/state.json | jq '.findings'
        exit 0
    fi
fi
```

## Phase 2: Quick Pattern Scan (200 tokens)

```bash
# Use Grep to find files with potential vulnerabilities
echo "Scanning for common vulnerability patterns..."

VULN_FILES=$(Grep "eval\(|dangerouslySetInnerHTML|innerHTML|exec\(" \
                  glob="**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}" \
                  output_mode="files_with_matches")

if [ -z "$VULN_FILES" ]; then
    echo "✓ No obvious vulnerabilities found"
    # Cache negative result
    save_cache "clean"
    exit 0
fi

echo "Found potential issues in $(echo "$VULN_FILES" | wc -l) files"
```

## Phase 3: Targeted Analysis (2,000 tokens)

```bash
# Only read files that matched vulnerability patterns
CONFIRMED_VULNS=0

for file in $VULN_FILES; do
    # Get specific matches with context
    MATCHES=$(Grep "eval\(|dangerouslySetInnerHTML" \
                   path="$file" \
                   output_mode="content" \
                   -A=3 -B=1)

    # Analyze if it's a real vulnerability or false positive
    if is_real_vulnerability "$MATCHES"; then
        CONFIRMED_VULNS=$((CONFIRMED_VULNS + 1))
        log_vulnerability "$file" "$MATCHES"
    fi

    # Early exit after finding 10 (sufficient for report)
    if [ $CONFIRMED_VULNS -ge 10 ]; then
        echo "Found 10+ vulnerabilities, stopping scan"
        break
    fi
done
```

## Phase 4: Cache Results (50 tokens)

```bash
# Save findings to cache
save_cache "$CONFIRMED_VULNS vulnerabilities found"
echo "✓ Scan complete and cached"
```

**Total: ~2,350 tokens (first run) / ~100 tokens (cached)**
**Cost: $0.007 first run, $0.0003 cached**
**Savings: 93% (first run), 99.7% (cached)**
```

**Optimization Breakdown:**

| Phase             | Before     | After                | Savings |
| ----------------- | ---------- | -------------------- | ------- |
| File Reading      | 25,000     | 0 (Grep instead)     | 100%    |
| Config Reading    | 450        | 0 (not needed)       | 100%    |
| Pattern Discovery | 0          | 200 (Grep)           | N/A     |
| Targeted Reading  | 0          | 2,000 (only matches) | N/A     |
| Analysis          | 5,000      | 100 (focused)        | 98%     |
| Report            | 2,000      | 50 (summary)         | 97.5%   |
| **Total**         | **32,450** | **2,350**            | **93%** |

### Example 2: Optimizing /review

**Original Implementation (❌ Unoptimized):**

```markdown
# review skill (BEFORE)

I'll perform a comprehensive code review.

```bash
# Read all source files
ALL_FILES=$(find src -name "*.ts")
for file in $ALL_FILES; do
    # Read each file completely (40 files × 400 tokens = 16,000 tokens)
done

# Read all test files
TEST_FILES=$(find src -name "*.test.ts")
for file in $TEST_FILES; do
    # Read each test file (20 files × 300 tokens = 6,000 tokens)
done

# Spawn multiple Task agents for analysis
# - Security agent: 5,000 tokens
# - Performance agent: 5,000 tokens
# - Quality agent: 5,000 tokens
# - Architecture agent: 5,000 tokens

# Generate comprehensive report: 3,000 tokens
```

**Total: ~45,000 tokens**
**Cost: $0.135 per run**
```

**Optimized Implementation (✅ Optimized):**

```markdown
# review skill (AFTER)

I'll perform an efficient code review with multi-agent analysis.

<think>
Optimization approach:
1. Use shared project cache if available
2. Use Grep to find code smell patterns
3. Only spawn Task agents for files with issues
4. Use progressive disclosure for agent analysis
</think>

## Phase 1: Check Shared Cache (200 tokens)

```bash
# Check if /analyze-project has run recently
if [ -f .claude/project-analysis/cache.json ]; then
    echo "✓ Using shared project analysis cache"
    PROJECT_STRUCTURE=$(cat .claude/project-analysis/cache.json | jq '.project_structure')
    FILE_LIST=$(cat .claude/project-analysis/cache.json | jq -r '.file_discovery.all_source_files[]')

    # Saved ~10,000 tokens by not re-analyzing project
else
    echo "Hint: Run /analyze-project first for 60% faster reviews"
    # Quick analysis with Glob only
    FILE_LIST=$(Glob "src/**/*.ts")
fi
```

## Phase 2: Quick Code Smell Detection (500 tokens)

```bash
# Use Grep to find potential issues (not Read)
echo "Scanning for code smells..."

# Common anti-patterns
COMPLEX_FUNCTIONS=$(Grep "function.*{[^}]{500,}" output_mode="count" glob="src/**/*.ts")
LONG_FILES=$(Grep "^" output_mode="count" glob="src/**/*.ts" | jq 'to_entries | .[] | select(.value > 300)')
TODO_COMMENTS=$(Grep "TODO|FIXME" output_mode="count")

# Calculate issue score
ISSUE_SCORE=$(calculate_issue_score "$COMPLEX_FUNCTIONS" "$LONG_FILES" "$TODO_COMMENTS")

if [ $ISSUE_SCORE -lt 10 ]; then
    echo "✓ Code quality looks good (score: $ISSUE_SCORE/100)"
    exit 0
fi
```

## Phase 3: Targeted Agent Analysis (4,000 tokens)

```bash
# Only spawn agents for problematic areas
if [ $ISSUE_SCORE -gt 50 ]; then
    echo "Spawning security agent for high-risk files..."
    # Task agent only for files with issues (not all files)
    # Token cost: ~4,000 vs. 20,000 for all files
fi
```

## Phase 4: Focused Report (300 tokens)

```bash
# Generate report focusing on found issues
# Reference cache files for details
# Token cost: 300 vs. 3,000 for full report
```

**Total: ~5,000 tokens (vs. 45,000)**
**Cost: $0.015 per run**
**Savings: 89%**
```

**Key Optimizations:**
1. Shared cache usage: -10,000 tokens
2. Grep instead of Read: -16,000 tokens
3. Conditional Task agents: -16,000 tokens
4. Focused reporting: -2,700 tokens

### Example 3: Optimizing /test

**Original Implementation (❌ Unoptimized):**

```markdown
# test skill (BEFORE)

I'll run your tests with intelligent failure analysis.

```bash
# Read package.json to find test command
cat package.json  # 400 tokens

# Read all test files to understand structure
for test_file in $(find . -name "*.test.*"); do
    # Read each test file (30 files × 300 tokens = 9,000 tokens)
done

# Run tests
npm test 2>&1  # Output: 2,000 tokens

# If failures, read source files to analyze
for failed_test in $FAILURES; do
    # Read source file for each failure (5 files × 500 tokens = 2,500 tokens)
done

# Generate detailed analysis
# Analysis: 3,000 tokens
```

**Total: ~17,000 tokens (with failures)**
**Cost: $0.051 per run**
```

**Optimized Implementation (✅ Optimized):**

```markdown
# test skill (AFTER)

I'll run your tests efficiently with smart failure analysis.

<think>
Optimization:
1. Use Grep to find test command (not Read full file)
2. Only read test files if tests fail
3. Only read source files related to failures
4. Use head to limit test output
</think>

## Phase 1: Quick Test Command Detection (50 tokens)

```bash
# Grep for test command (not Read entire file)
TEST_CMD=$(Grep "\"test\":" path="package.json" output_mode="content")

if [ -z "$TEST_CMD" ]; then
    echo "No test command found in package.json"
    exit 1
fi

echo "Found test command: $TEST_CMD"
```

## Phase 2: Run Tests with Output Limit (1,000 tokens)

```bash
# Run tests, limit output to last 100 lines
npm test 2>&1 | tail -n 100 > test_output.txt

# Check if tests passed
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "✓ All tests passed!"
    rm test_output.txt
    exit 0
fi

echo "Tests failed, analyzing failures..."
FAILURES=$(cat test_output.txt | grep "FAIL" | awk '{print $2}')
```

## Phase 3: Targeted Failure Analysis (2,000 tokens)

```bash
# Only read files related to failures
for failed_file in $FAILURES; do
    # Use Grep to get just the failing test context
    FAILING_TEST=$(Grep "it\(|test\(" path="$failed_file" output_mode="content" -A=10 head_limit=1)

    # Analyze specific failure
    analyze_failure "$failed_file" "$FAILING_TEST"

    # Stop after analyzing 3 failures (sufficient)
    if [ $ANALYZED -ge 3 ]; then
        echo "Analyzed 3 failures, see output for details"
        break
    fi
done
```

## Phase 4: Actionable Summary (200 tokens)

```bash
# Concise summary with file:line references
echo "=== Test Failures ==="
echo "1. src/auth.test.ts:45 - Authentication fails for expired token"
echo "2. src/api.test.ts:23 - API returns 500 instead of 404"
echo "3. src/utils.test.ts:67 - Date formatting incorrect for timezone"
echo ""
echo "Run with --verbose flag for detailed analysis"
```

**Total: ~3,250 tokens (with failures) / ~1,050 tokens (all pass)**
**Cost: $0.0098 with failures, $0.003 all pass**
**Savings: 81% (failures), 94% (all pass)**
```

**Key Optimizations:**
1. Grep instead of Read package.json: -350 tokens
2. Only read test files on failure: -9,000 tokens (conditional)
3. Limit test output: -1,000 tokens
4. Targeted failure analysis: -500 tokens
5. Concise summary: -2,800 tokens

disable-model-invocation: true
token-budget: 3000-5000
cache-enabled: true

# API Test Generation

I'll generate comprehensive API tests for your endpoints.

<think>
Token-efficient approach:
1. Use Grep to find API route definitions (not Read all files)
2. Use Grep to extract endpoint patterns
3. Only Read files with complex logic
4. Generate tests incrementally
5. Cache API schema for future use

Expected token usage:
- Phase 1 (Discovery): 300 tokens
- Phase 2 (Schema extraction): 800 tokens
- Phase 3 (Test generation): 2,000 tokens
- Total: ~3,100 tokens
</think>

## Phase 1: API Endpoint Discovery (300 tokens)

```bash
# Efficiently find API files based on framework
detect_api_framework

case $FRAMEWORK in
    "Express")
        # Grep for route definitions (not Read files)
        ENDPOINTS=$(Grep "app\.(get|post|put|delete|patch)\(|router\." \
                         glob="**/*.{js,ts}" \
                         output_mode="content" \
                         head_limit=20)
        ;;
    "FastAPI")
        ENDPOINTS=$(Grep "@app\.(get|post|put|delete|patch)" \
                         glob="**/*.py" \
                         output_mode="content" \
                         head_limit=20)
        ;;
    "Next.js")
        # API routes are file-based
        API_FILES=$(Glob "app/api/**/route.ts" "pages/api/**/*.ts")
        ENDPOINTS=$(Grep "export.*GET|export.*POST" \
                         glob="app/api/**/route.ts" \
                         output_mode="content")
        ;;
esac

echo "Found $(echo "$ENDPOINTS" | wc -l) API endpoints"
```

## Phase 2: Schema Extraction (800 tokens)

```bash
# Extract request/response schemas efficiently
for endpoint in $(echo "$ENDPOINTS" | head -n 10); do
    # Use Grep with context to get schemas (not Read full file)
    SCHEMA=$(Grep "interface.*Request|type.*Request|z\.object" \
                  output_mode="content" \
                  -A=15 \
                  head_limit=1)

    # Store in cache
    cache_schema "$endpoint" "$SCHEMA"
done

# Early exit if we have enough examples
if [ $SCHEMAS_FOUND -ge 10 ]; then
    echo "Extracted 10 endpoint schemas (sufficient for test generation)"
fi
```

## Phase 3: Test Generation (2,000 tokens)

```bash
# Generate tests based on cached schemas
for endpoint in $CACHED_ENDPOINTS; do
    SCHEMA=$(get_cached_schema "$endpoint")

    # Generate test file
    generate_test_file "$endpoint" "$SCHEMA"

    echo "✓ Generated test for $endpoint"
done

# Save cache for future runs
save_api_cache
```

**Total: ~3,100 tokens**
**Cost: $0.009 per run**

**Subsequent runs with cache: ~500 tokens**
**Cost: $0.0015 per run (83% savings)**
```

**Optimization Techniques Used:**
1. ✅ Framework detection without reading files
2. ✅ Grep for endpoint discovery (not Read)
3. ✅ head_limit=20 to cap discoveries
4. ✅ Schema caching for reuse
5. ✅ Early exit after 10 endpoints
6. ✅ Incremental test generation

### Example 5: Tier 2 Skill - /test-mutation

**Mutation Testing with Token Efficiency:**

```markdown
---
name: test-mutation
description: Mutation testing to verify test quality using Stryker, mutmut, or go-mutesting
disable-model-invocation: true
token-budget: 2000-4000
---

# Mutation Testing

I'll verify your test quality using mutation testing.

<think>
Token optimization:
1. Detect test framework via bash (50 tokens)
2. Grep for test files (200 tokens)
3. Only install mutator if not present
4. Run mutations incrementally
5. Cache mutation scores
Expected: 2,500 tokens
</think>

## Phase 1: Framework Detection (50 tokens)

```bash
# Efficient framework detection via package.json
if grep -q "\"jest\"" package.json; then
    TEST_FRAMEWORK="jest"
    MUTATOR="stryker-js"
elif grep -q "pytest" requirements.txt 2>/dev/null; then
    TEST_FRAMEWORK="pytest"
    MUTATOR="mutmut"
fi

echo "Detected: $TEST_FRAMEWORK, using $MUTATOR"
```

## Phase 2: Test Discovery (200 tokens)

```bash
# Use Grep to find test files (not Read)
TEST_FILES=$(Grep "test|describe|it\(" glob="**/*.{test,spec}.{js,ts,py}" output_mode="files_with_matches")
TEST_COUNT=$(echo "$TEST_FILES" | wc -l)

echo "Found $TEST_COUNT test files"

# Early exit if no tests
if [ $TEST_COUNT -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "No tests found, mutation testing requires tests"
    exit 1
fi
```

## Phase 3: Incremental Mutation (1,500 tokens)

```bash
# Run mutations on subset of files
SAMPLE_SIZE=5
SAMPLE_FILES=$(echo "$TEST_FILES" | head -n $SAMPLE_SIZE)

echo "Running mutations on $SAMPLE_SIZE files (representative sample)..."

for file in $SAMPLE_FILES; do
    # Run mutation testing
    # Limit output to summary only
done

echo "Mutation score: 85% (5 files tested)"
echo "Run on full suite: npm run test:mutation:all"
```

**Total: ~2,500 tokens**
**Without optimization: ~15,000 tokens (all files, full output)**
**Savings: 83%**
```

### Example 6: Tier 2 Skill - /lighthouse

**Performance Auditing with Token Efficiency:**

```markdown
---
name: lighthouse
description: Run Lighthouse audits with automated performance, accessibility, and SEO fixes
token-budget: 1500-3000
---

# Lighthouse Audits

I'll run Lighthouse audits and suggest automated fixes.

<think>
Token optimization:
1. Check if Lighthouse is installed (bash, 20 tokens)
2. Run audit with JSON output (1,000 tokens)
3. Parse only failing audits with jq (500 tokens)
4. Generate fixes for top 5 issues (800 tokens)
Total: ~2,300 tokens
</think>

## Phase 1: Quick Installation Check (20 tokens)

```bash
if ! command -v lighthouse &> /dev/null; then
    echo "Installing Lighthouse..."
    npm install -g lighthouse
fi
```

## Phase 2: Run Audit (1,000 tokens)

```bash
# Run Lighthouse with minimal output
lighthouse http://localhost:3000 \
    --output=json \
    --output-path=.claude/lighthouse/report.json \
    --quiet \
    --chrome-flags="--headless"

# Extract only failing audits (not full report)
FAILURES=$(jq '[.audits | to_entries[] | select(.value.score < 0.9)] | length' .claude/lighthouse/report.json)

echo "Found $FAILURES issues requiring attention"
```

## Phase 3: Targeted Fixes (800 tokens)

```bash
# Parse and fix top 5 issues only
jq '[.audits | to_entries[] | select(.value.score < 0.9)] | .[0:5]' \
   .claude/lighthouse/report.json > top_issues.json

# Generate fixes for each issue
while IFS= read -r issue; do
    TITLE=$(echo "$issue" | jq -r '.value.title')
    generate_fix "$TITLE"
done < <(jq -c '.[]' top_issues.json)
```

**Total: ~2,300 tokens**
**Without optimization: ~8,000 tokens (full report parsing)**
**Savings: 71%**
```

### Example 7: Tier 3 Skill - /infrastructure

**Infrastructure as Code with Token Efficiency:**

```markdown
---
name: infrastructure
description: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, and Pulumi
token-budget: 2500-5000
---

# Infrastructure as Code

I'll help you set up Infrastructure as Code with intelligent framework selection.

<think>
Token optimization:
1. Detect existing IaC files via Glob (50 tokens)
2. If none exist, bash check for cloud provider (100 tokens)
3. Generate template based on provider (1,500 tokens)
4. Use template library (not generate from scratch)
5. Cache provider config
Expected: 3,000 tokens
</think>

## Phase 1: IaC Discovery (50 tokens)

```bash
# Use Glob to find existing IaC files (fastest)
TERRAFORM=$(Glob "**/*.tf")
CLOUDFORMATION=$(Glob "**/*.{yaml,yml}" | grep -i cloudformation)
PULUMI=$(Glob "**/Pulumi.yaml")

if [ -n "$TERRAFORM" ]; then
    echo "Found Terraform configuration"
    IaC_TOOL="terraform"
    exit 0
elif [ -n "$CLOUDFORMATION" ]; then
    echo "Found CloudFormation templates"
    IaC_TOOL="cloudformation"
    exit 0
elif [ -n "$PULUMI" ]; then
    echo "Found Pulumi project"
    IaC_TOOL="pulumi"
    exit 0
fi
```

## Phase 2: Provider Detection (100 tokens)

```bash
# Only if no IaC exists, detect cloud provider
if grep -q "aws-sdk" package.json; then
    CLOUD_PROVIDER="AWS"
    RECOMMEND="Terraform or CloudFormation"
elif grep -q "azure-" package.json; then
    CLOUD_PROVIDER="Azure"
    RECOMMEND="Terraform or ARM"
elif grep -q "google-cloud" package.json; then
    CLOUD_PROVIDER="GCP"
    RECOMMEND="Terraform or Deployment Manager"
fi

echo "Detected cloud provider: $CLOUD_PROVIDER"
```

## Phase 3: Template Generation (1,500 tokens)

```bash
# Use pre-built templates (not generate from scratch)
# Templates are compact and optimized
cat > main.tf <<'EOF'
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
}

# VPC, subnets, security groups generated based on requirements
EOF

echo "✓ Generated Terraform configuration"
echo "Review main.tf and run: terraform init"
```

**Total: ~3,000 tokens**
**Without optimization: ~12,000 tokens (generate everything from scratch)**
**Savings: 75%**
```

### Example 8: Tier 3 Skill - /parallel-agents

**Multi-Agent Orchestration with Token Efficiency:**

```markdown
---
name: parallel-agents
description: Multi-agent orchestration using Boris Cherny workflow patterns
token-budget: 5000-15000
---

# Parallel Agent Orchestration

I'll orchestrate multiple specialized agents to work on independent tasks in parallel.

<think>
Token optimization for multi-agent work:
1. Decompose task into truly independent subtasks
2. Use Task tool ONLY for complex subtasks
3. Use direct tools (Bash/Grep/Read) for simple subtasks
4. Each agent gets minimal context (not full project)
5. Agents write results to state files
6. Main process summarizes from state files (not agent outputs)

Expected: 8,000-12,000 tokens (worth it for complex orchestration)
</think>

## Phase 1: Task Decomposition (500 tokens)

```bash
# Analyze user request
# Break into independent subtasks
# Determine which need agents vs. direct tools

TASK_1="security-scan"      # Agent (complex analysis)
TASK_2="update-deps"        # Direct bash (simple)
TASK_3="test-coverage"      # Agent (analysis required)
TASK_4="format-code"        # Direct bash (simple)
```

## Phase 2: Parallel Execution (10,000 tokens)

```bash
# Launch complex tasks as background agents
# Run simple tasks directly

# Complex: Use Task tool
Task "security-scan" run_in_background=true  # ~4,000 tokens
Task "test-coverage analysis" run_in_background=true  # ~4,000 tokens

# Simple: Direct execution
npm update --save  # 100 tokens
npm run format  # 100 tokens

echo "Agents working in parallel..."
echo "Simple tasks completed"
```

## Phase 3: Result Aggregation (1,500 tokens)

```bash
# Don't include full agent outputs in context
# Read state files and summarize

SECURITY_FINDINGS=$(jq '.findings | length' .claude/security-scan/state.json)
COVERAGE=$(jq '.coverage_percent' .claude/test-coverage/state.json)

echo "=== Parallel Execution Complete ==="
echo "Security scan: $SECURITY_FINDINGS issues (see state file)"
echo "Test coverage: $COVERAGE%"
echo "Dependencies: Updated"
echo "Formatting: Applied"
```

**Total: ~12,000 tokens (multi-agent orchestration)**
**Value: 4 tasks in parallel vs. sequential**
**Time saved: 4x faster execution**

**Note:** High token count is justified here because:
- Spawning agents for genuinely complex tasks
- Tasks run in parallel (time savings)
- Simpler tasks use direct tools (not agents)
- Results aggregated from state files (not full outputs)
```

### Example 9: New Tier 2 Pattern - Shared Analysis Cache

**Cross-Skill Optimization:**

```markdown
# Multiple skills now share .claude/project-analysis/cache.json

**Skills benefiting from shared cache:**
1. /security-scan
2. /review
3. /predict-issues
4. /understand
5. /refactor
6. /test-coverage
7. /complexity-reduce
8. /duplication-detect
9. /accessibility
10. /architecture-diagram

**Cache Structure:**
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "framework": "Next.js",
  "language": "TypeScript",
  "files": {
    "source": ["src/app.ts", ...],
    "test": ["src/app.test.ts", ...],
    "config": ["package.json", ...]
  },
  "dependencies": {...},
  "metrics": {...}
}
```

**Token Savings Example:**

Without shared cache:
- Each skill discovers project structure: 10 skills × 2,000 tokens = 20,000 tokens

With shared cache:
- First skill generates cache: 2,000 tokens
- Other 9 skills read cache: 9 × 100 tokens = 900 tokens
- Total: 2,900 tokens
- **Savings: 85.5% (17,100 tokens)**

**Real-World Impact:**
- Running full analysis suite (10 skills)
- Before: 20,000 + (10 × 8,000) = 100,000 tokens
- After: 2,900 + (10 × 4,000) = 42,900 tokens
- **Total savings: 57%**
```

## Optimization Checklist

### Pre-Implementation Checklist

**Before writing a new skill:**

- [ ] **Define token budget**: What's the acceptable token range?
- [ ] **Identify minimum information needed**: What's truly required vs. nice-to-have?
- [ ] **Plan tool usage**: Which tools (Glob/Grep/Read/Task) will you use?
- [ ] **Design caching strategy**: Can results be cached? For how long?
- [ ] **Define early exit conditions**: When can processing stop?
- [ ] **Consider shared cache**: Can this skill reuse analysis from other skills?
- [ ] **Plan progressive disclosure**: Can analysis start shallow and go deep only if needed?

### Implementation Checklist

**While implementing the skill:**

- [ ] **Use Glob before Read**: Always discover files with Glob first
- [ ] **Use Grep before Read**: Search for patterns with Grep before loading files
- [ ] **Set head_limit on Grep**: Cap results to prevent token explosion
- [ ] **Use appropriate Grep output_mode**:
  - [ ] files_with_matches for discovery
  - [ ] count for metrics
  - [ ] content only when necessary
- [ ] **Implement caching**:
  - [ ] Create .claude/skill-name/ directory
  - [ ] Save state.json with results
  - [ ] Add cache validation logic
  - [ ] Include file checksums for invalidation
- [ ] **Add early exit logic**: Stop processing when goal achieved
- [ ] **Batch operations**: Group related Reads together
- [ ] **Use offset/limit for large files**: Don't read entire large files
- [ ] **Reference state files**: Don't repeat information already in cache
- [ ] **Keep context minimal**: Summarize, don't repeat full details

### Post-Implementation Checklist

**After implementing the skill:**

- [ ] **Measure token usage**:
  - [ ] Test with small project (< 20 files)
  - [ ] Test with medium project (50-100 files)
  - [ ] Test with large project (500+ files)
- [ ] **Verify caching**:
  - [ ] First run creates cache
  - [ ] Second run uses cache
  - [ ] Cache invalidation works correctly
- [ ] **Test early exit**:
  - [ ] Stops after N findings
  - [ ] Doesn't process unnecessary files
- [ ] **Compare with unoptimized**:
  - [ ] Calculate token savings percentage
  - [ ] Verify no functionality loss
- [ ] **Document token budget**:
  - [ ] Add expected token range to skill
  - [ ] Document optimization strategies used
- [ ] **Update README/docs**:
  - [ ] Note if skill uses caching
  - [ ] Mention token efficiency

### Optimization Audit Checklist

**For existing skills that need optimization:**

- [ ] **Analyze current token usage**:
  - [ ] Identify high-token operations
  - [ ] Find redundant file reads
  - [ ] Locate missing early exits
- [ ] **Add caching layer**:
  - [ ] Implement state file
  - [ ] Add cache validation
  - [ ] Test cache hit/miss scenarios
- [ ] **Replace Read with Grep**:
  - [ ] Find pattern searches in Read operations
  - [ ] Convert to Grep + conditional Read
- [ ] **Add early exit conditions**:
  - [ ] Define when "enough" information is gathered
  - [ ] Implement stopping logic
- [ ] **Optimize Grep usage**:
  - [ ] Change output_mode if appropriate
  - [ ] Add head_limit to cap results
  - [ ] Use glob parameter to narrow scope
- [ ] **Implement progressive disclosure**:
  - [ ] Start with quick scan
  - [ ] Deep analysis only if needed
- [ ] **Test optimization**:
  - [ ] Measure before/after tokens
  - [ ] Verify functionality unchanged
  - [ ] Document savings achieved

## Common Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: Read All, Filter Later

**❌ Bad:**
```bash
# Read all files first, then filter
for file in $(ls src/**/*.ts); do
    CONTENT=$(Read "$file")
    if echo "$CONTENT" | grep -q "TODO"; then
        # Process file
    fi
done
# Token cost: 50 files × 500 tokens = 25,000 tokens
```

**✅ Good:**
```bash
# Filter with Grep first, then read only matches
FILES_WITH_TODO=$(Grep "TODO" glob="src/**/*.ts" output_mode="files_with_matches")
for file in $FILES_WITH_TODO; do
    # Now read only files that have TODOs
    CONTENT=$(Read "$file")
    # Process file
done
# Token cost: 100 (Grep) + 5 matches × 500 (Read) = 2,600 tokens
# Savings: 90%
```

### Anti-Pattern 2: No Caching

**❌ Bad:**
```bash
# Every run: analyze everything from scratch
echo "Analyzing project structure..."
# Scan all files: 10,000 tokens
# Every. Single. Time.
```

**✅ Good:**
```bash
# First run: analyze and cache
if [ ! -f .claude/skill-name/cache.json ]; then
    echo "First run: analyzing project..."
    # Analyze: 10,000 tokens
    # Save to cache
else
    echo "Using cached analysis..."
    # Load from cache: 100 tokens
    # Savings: 99%
fi
```

### Anti-Pattern 3: Unlimited Search Results

**❌ Bad:**
```bash
# Find all TODO comments (might be thousands)
Grep "TODO" output_mode="content"
# Returns: 1,000 matches × 5 lines context = 5,000 lines
# Token cost: 15,000 tokens
```

**✅ Good:**
```bash
# Find first 10 TODO comments (sufficient for report)
Grep "TODO" output_mode="content" head_limit=10
# Returns: 10 matches × 5 lines context = 50 lines
# Token cost: 500 tokens
# Savings: 97%
```

### Anti-Pattern 4: Spawning Task for Simple Operations

**❌ Bad:**
```bash
# Spawn entire agent to find a file
Task "Find package.json and tell me the version"
# Token cost: 3,000 tokens (agent overhead + execution)
```

**✅ Good:**
```bash
# Direct Grep operation
VERSION=$(Grep "\"version\":" path="package.json" output_mode="content")
# Token cost: 50 tokens
# Savings: 98%
```

### Anti-Pattern 5: Reading Same File Multiple Times

**❌ Bad:**
```bash
# Read package.json multiple times
DEPS=$(Read package.json | jq '.dependencies')
SCRIPTS=$(Read package.json | jq '.scripts')
VERSION=$(Read package.json | jq '.version')
# Token cost: 400 × 3 = 1,200 tokens
```

**✅ Good:**
```bash
# Read once, extract multiple times
PACKAGE_JSON=$(Read package.json)
DEPS=$(echo "$PACKAGE_JSON" | jq '.dependencies')
SCRIPTS=$(echo "$PACKAGE_JSON" | jq '.scripts')
VERSION=$(echo "$PACKAGE_JSON" | jq '.version')
# Token cost: 400 tokens
# Savings: 67%
```

### Anti-Pattern 6: Verbose Context Preservation

**❌ Bad:**
```bash
# Keep all details in context
echo "I found these issues in the previous analysis:"
echo "File: src/app.ts, Line: 45, Issue: SQL injection vulnerability"
echo "The vulnerable code is: const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ' + userId"
echo "This is dangerous because user input is concatenated directly into SQL"
echo "An attacker could inject: 1 OR 1=1-- to bypass authentication"
echo "The fix would be to use parameterized queries: db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', [userId])"
# ... repeat for 50 more issues ...
# Token cost: 5,000 tokens maintained in context
```

**✅ Good:**
```bash
# Reference state file, keep summary only
echo "Previous analysis found 50 issues (see .claude/security-scan/findings.json)"
echo "Top priority: SQL injection in src/app.ts:45"
# Token cost: 100 tokens in context
# Full details available in state file when needed
# Savings: 98%
```

### Anti-Pattern 7: No Early Exit

**❌ Bad:**
```bash
# Scan all 1,000 files even after finding critical issue
for file in $(Glob "**/*.ts"); do
    scan_for_vulnerabilities "$file"
    # Continue scanning even if critical vulnerability found
done
echo "Found 1 critical, 5 high, 20 medium vulnerabilities"
# Token cost: 50,000 tokens to scan everything
```

**✅ Good:**
```bash
# Stop after finding critical issue
for file in $(Glob "**/*.ts"); do
    if scan_for_vulnerabilities "$file"; then
        if [ "$SEVERITY" = "critical" ]; then
            echo "🚨 Critical vulnerability found in $file"
            echo "Stopping scan to address immediately"
            exit 1
        fi
    fi
done
# Token cost: 5,000 tokens (only scanned 10% of files)
# Savings: 90%
```

### Anti-Pattern 8: Not Using Glob for Discovery

**❌ Bad:**
```bash
# Use bash find and read paths
FILES=$(find src -name "*.ts" -type f)
for file in $FILES; do
    process "$file"
done
# Verbose output from find, then processing
```

**✅ Good:**
```bash
# Use Glob for clean file discovery
FILES=$(Glob "src/**/*.ts")
for file in $FILES; do
    process "$file"
done
# Clean paths, minimal tokens
```

### Anti-Pattern 9: Full File Reads for Partial Information

**❌ Bad:**
```bash
# Read entire 2,000-line file to check one function
FILE_CONTENT=$(Read src/large-file.ts)
# Token cost: 6,000 tokens
# Then search for function in the content
```

**✅ Good:**
```bash
# Grep for the function first
FUNCTION=$(Grep "function targetFunction" path="src/large-file.ts" output_mode="content" -A=20)
# Token cost: 200 tokens
# Savings: 97%
```

### Anti-Pattern 10: Ignoring Framework Conventions

**❌ Bad:**
```bash
# Analyze every file to detect framework
for file in $(Glob "**/*"); do
    analyze_for_framework_indicators "$file"
done
# Token cost: 30,000 tokens
```

**✅ Good:**
```bash
# Check conventional indicators first
if [ -f "next.config.js" ]; then
    echo "Framework: Next.js"
elif [ -f "vue.config.js" ]; then
    echo "Framework: Vue"
elif grep -q "\"react\"" package.json; then
    echo "Framework: React"
fi
# Token cost: 100 tokens
# Savings: 99.7%
```
