- **Grep before Read**: Use Grep for discovery (50-500 tokens vs 5,000-10,000 tokens for Read)
- **Bash script detection**: Framework/tool detection via bash (minimal tokens)
- **Progressive disclosure**: Load only necessary content
- **Template-based generation**: Minimize token usage in code generation

**Average Token Savings**: 60-90% compared to unoptimized approaches

### Architecture Patterns

All skills follow established patterns:
- ✅ Official Claude Skills format with YAML frontmatter
- ✅ Conversational first-person language ("I'll help you...")
- ✅ Safety-first design with git checkpoints
- ✅ No AI attribution in any generated content
- ✅ Framework-agnostic with intelligent auto-detection
- ✅ Integration points with existing skills
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Extended thinking for complex decisions

### Platform Support

**Languages**: JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, Ruby
**Frameworks**: React, Vue, Next.js, Express, FastAPI, Django, and many more
