## Optimization Strategies by Category

### Universal Patterns (All 37 Skills)

1. **Grep-Before-Read (90% savings)**
   - Always use Grep to discover files before reading
   - Use `output_mode="files_with_matches"` for discovery
   - Only read files that match criteria

2. **Caching Layer (70-99% on cache hits)**
   - Framework/platform detection: `.claude/cache/project-analysis.json`
   - Tool availability: `.claude/cache/tools.json`
   - Schema/API definitions: `.claude/cache/[skill-name]/schema.json`
   - Previous results: `.claude/cache/[skill-name]/last-results.json`

3. **Early Exit (50-80% savings when applicable)**
   - Quick validation before deep analysis
   - Stop after finding N examples (N=5-10 usually sufficient)
   - Exit immediately on critical issues
   - No issues found → exit with ✓ message

4. **Progressive Disclosure (60-85% savings)**
   - Level 1: Critical issues only (default)
   - Level 2: Critical + High (--verbose)
   - Level 3: All issues (--verbose --all)
   - Users typically only need Level 1

5. **Focus Areas/Scope Limiting (70-90% savings)**
   - Default: Git diff (changed files only)
   - Optional: Specific path parameter
   - Flag: --full for complete project scan
   - Most runs only need changed files

6. **head_limit on Searches (80-95% savings)**
   - Always limit Grep results
   - Typical limits: 5-20 results
   - Provide --limit flag for more results
   - Prevents token explosion on large codebases

### Category-Specific Patterns

**Testing & Debugging:**
- Bash-based tool execution (jest, vitest, lighthouse, etc.)
- Framework detection caching
- Test file discovery with Glob
- Focused error analysis (don't analyze all tests, just failures)

**CI/CD & DevOps:**
- Template-based generation (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Docker)
- Platform detection caching
- Incremental resource analysis
- State files for multi-step deployments

**API & Database:**
- Schema caching (OpenAPI, GraphQL, database schemas)
- Endpoint discovery with Grep
- MCP integration for external resources
- Template-based generation (mocks, types, docs)

**Git & Code Quality:**
- Bash-based Git operations
- Complexity/duplication pattern detection
- Template libraries for scaffolding
- Incremental analysis (changed files only)
