- **Knowledge Transfer**: Enable team collaboration with detailed session histories

## Project Infrastructure

Beyond skills, Claude DevStudio ships a complete project-level infrastructure that wires up commands, agents, hooks, MCP servers, and auto-loaded rules.

### Commands

Commands (`.claude/commands/`) are high-level orchestrators that sequence multiple skills and agents, aggregate results, and manage user interaction. Invoke with `/command-name`.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/quality-pipeline` | Runs `/security-scan` → `/review` → `/test` in sequence; writes combined report to `reports/quality-pipeline-<date>.md` |
| `/release-workflow` | Full release flow: `/deploy-validate` → `/changelog-auto` → version bump → `/commit`; prompts for version type |
| `/session-daily` | Daily startup: start session, git status, find todos, project health check, security pulse, daily briefing |
| `/architecture:skill-system` | Mid-session reference: skill tiers, YAML frontmatter fields, naming conventions, token budgets |
| `/architecture:hook-events` | Mid-session reference: all 19 hook events, settings structure, compact reminder hook |
| `/architecture:agent-command-system` | Mid-session reference: Command/Agent/Skill hierarchy, agent table, persistent memory |

### Agents

Agents (`.claude/agents/`) are specialized workers with restricted tool sets. They are invoked by commands or directly, run in isolated context, and cannot perform operations outside their defined tool scope.

| Agent | Tools | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `code-reviewer` | Read, Grep, Glob, WebFetch (read-only) | Deep code review; backs the `/review` skill |
| `security-auditor` | Read, Grep, Glob, Bash (grep/git log only) | Security scanning; backs `/security-scan`, `/owasp-check`, `/secrets-scan` |
| `test-runner` | Read, Bash (test commands only) | Test execution; backs `/test`, `/tdd-red-green`, `/test-coverage` |
| `claude-md-auditor` | Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Edit | Documentation drift detection — cross-references skill counts, tier totals, and file references across CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, README.md and surgically corrects discrepancies |
| `quality-fixer` | Read, Bash, Edit, Glob, Grep | Iterative lint/shellcheck/type fix cycles (max 5 iterations) for Python and shell scripts |

Agents use a **persistent memory pattern**: each agent has a `.claude/agent-memory/<name>/MEMORY.md` file loaded on every invocation, accumulating institutional knowledge about the codebase across conversations.

### Project-Local Skills

`.claude/skills/` holds internal skills consumed by agents and commands. These are hidden from the user menu (`user-invocable: false`) and are distinct from the 99 user-facing skills in `skills/`.

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `project-health` | Checks skill count consistency across docs, stale sessions, cache size, install script syntax |
| `skill-validator` | Validates new skills: YAML frontmatter, Token Optimization section, line limit, naming conventions |

### Hooks

Claude DevStudio registers handlers for all 19 Claude Code hook events via `.claude/hooks/scripts/hooks.py`. Hooks fire automatically — no user action required.

**What hooks do:**

- Play audio notifications on tool use, session start/end, errors, and task completion (platform-aware: `afplay` on macOS, `paplay`/`aplay`/`ffplay` on Linux, `winsound` on Windows)
- Log every event to `.claude/hooks/hooks-log.jsonl` with timestamp, event type, and tool name
- Support agent-specific sound mapping via `--agent=<name>` argument
- Inject a structured codebase reminder after context compaction events (`SessionStart` with `compact` matcher) to restore critical context lost during compaction
- Degrade gracefully when no audio player is available (log only)

**Supported hook events:**

```
PreToolUse      PostToolUse      PostToolUseFailure   PermissionRequest
UserPromptSubmit  Notification    Stop                 SubagentStart
SubagentStop    PreCompact       SessionStart          SessionEnd
Setup           TeammateIdle    TaskCompleted         ConfigChange
WorktreeCreate  WorktreeRemove  InstructionsLoaded
```

See [.claude/hooks/README.md](.claude/hooks/README.md) for configuration details.

### Auto-Loaded Rules

`.claude/rules/` contains Markdown rule files that Claude Code auto-loads for every conversation. Rules extend CLAUDE.md without bloating it beyond the ~200 line best-practice limit.

| Rule File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `skill-development.md` | YAML frontmatter fields, skill sections, naming conventions, tier criteria, token budget table |
| `git-workflow.md` | AI credential prohibition, conventional commits format, checkpoint rule, branch strategy |
| `code-quality.md` | Python/Shell/Markdown standards, no emoji, Edit-before-Write, install script sync rule |
| `token-optimization.md` | 8 optimization patterns with % savings, mandatory Token Optimization section template |

### MCP Servers

`.mcp.json` configures project-scoped MCP servers available in every Claude Code session:

| Server | Package | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `context7` | `@upstash/context7-mcp` | Up-to-date library docs — prevents hallucinated APIs |
| `playwright` | `@playwright/mcp` | Browser automation for `/playwright-automate` and `/e2e-generate` |
| `github` | `@modelcontextprotocol/server-github` | GitHub automation; requires `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var |
| `filesystem` | `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem` | Inspect `~/.claude/skills/` without Bash |

### Project Settings

`.claude/settings.json` applies project-level Claude Code configuration:

- **Model**: `claude-sonnet-4-6`
- **Output style**: concise (matches project brevity preference)
- **Permissions**: pre-approved `Bash(git:*)`, `Bash(grep:*)`, `Edit(**)`, `Write(**)` etc.; `ask` for `Bash(rm:*)`, `Bash(git push:*)`, `Bash(sudo:*)`
- **All 19 hooks** registered to `.claude/hooks/scripts/hooks.py`
- **Plans directory**: `./reports`

## Real World Example

### Before `/cleanproject`

```plaintext
src/
├── UserService.js
├── UserService.test.js
├── UserService_backup.js    # Old version
├── debug.log               # Debug output
├── test_temp.js           # Temporary test
└── notes.txt              # Dev notes
```

### After `/cleanproject`

```plaintext
src/
├── UserService.js          # Clean production code
└── UserService.test.js     # Actual tests preserved
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### High-Level Architecture

Claude DevStudio transforms Claude Code CLI into an intelligent development assistant through a three-tier Command → Agent → Skill architecture:

```plaintext
Developer
    │
    ├─ /command   → Command (.claude/commands/) → orchestrates multiple agents/skills
    │                        │
    │                        ├─ Agent (.claude/agents/) → specialized worker with restricted tools
    │                        │          │
    │                        └─────────→└─ Skill (skills/ or .claude/skills/) → atomic capability
    │
    └─ /skill     → Skill (skills/) → direct execution
    ↑                                                    ↓
    ←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←← Clear Feedback & Results ←←←←←←←←
```

Hook events fire automatically at each lifecycle point (tool use, session start/end, etc.), enabling notifications and logging without user intervention.

### Execution Flow

```
# Each skill creates its own folder in project root:
refactor/                  # Created by /refactor skill
├── plan.md               # Refactoring roadmap
└── state.json            # Completed transformations

implement/                 # Created by /implement skill
├── plan.md               # Implementation progress
└── state.json            # Session state and decisions

fix-imports/              # Created by /fix-imports skill
├── plan.md               # Import fixes plan
└── state.json            # Resolution progress

security-scan/            # Created by /security-scan skill
├── plan.md               # Vulnerabilities and fixes

```

**📚 Session Management System**
Advanced session tracking with Claude Code integration:

```
.claude/                   # Claude Code directory
├── sessions/             # Session storage directory
│   ├── .current-session # Tracks active session filename
│   ├── 2025-01-16-1347-feature-auth.md  # Named session file
│   ├── 2025-01-17-0930.md               # Timestamp-only session
│   └── feature-areas/    # Organized by project areas
│       ├── authentication/
│       ├── database/
│       └── ui-components/
└── CLAUDE.md            # Claude Code memory file
```

## 🧠 Technical Notes

### Design Philosophy

**Why This Approach Works** (Based on Anthropic's Research):

- **Conversational Skills**: First-person language ("I'll help...") activates Claude's collaborative reasoning
- **Build-Agnostic Instructions**: No hardcoded tools = works everywhere
- **Think Tool Integration**: Strategic thinking improves decisions by 50%+ (Anthropic, 2025)
- **Native Tools Only**: Uses Claude Code's actual capabilities, not imaginary APIs

**Key Principles:**

- **Simplicity > Complexity**: Start simple, add only when proven necessary
- **Context Awareness**: Skills adapt to YOUR project, not vice versa
- **Safety First**: Git checkpoints before any destructive operation
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learn from your codebase, not assumptions

### Technical Architecture

**Native Tool Integration:**
All skills leverage Claude Code CLI's native capabilities:

- Grep tool for efficient pattern matching
- Glob tool for file discovery
- Read tool for content analysis
- TodoWrite for progress tracking
- Sub-agents for specialized analysis

**Safety-First Design:**

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Pre-operation checkpoint" || echo "No changes to commit"
```

**Conversational Interface:**
Skills use first-person collaborative language ("I'll analyze your code...") rather than imperative instructions, creating a natural partnership interaction that improves model performance.

**Framework Agnostic:**
Intelligent detection without hardcoded assumptions enables universal compatibility across technology stacks.

### User Skills Indicator

Custom skills appear with a `(user)` tag in Claude Code CLI to distinguish them from built-in skills. This is normal and indicates your skills are properly installed.

```
/commit
    Smart Git Commit (user)    ← Your custom skill
/help
    Show help                  ← Built-in skill
```

I'll help you with your specific workflow.

[Your instructions here]
```

### Using Arguments

Skills support arguments via `$ARGUMENTS`:

```bash
/myskill some-file.js
# $ARGUMENTS will contain "some-file.js"
```

### CI/CD Integration

Use skills in automated workflows:

```bash
# Quality pipeline
claude "/security-scan" && claude "/review" && claude "/test"

# Pre-commit validation  
claude "/format" && claude "/commit"

# Feature development
claude "/scaffold api-users" && claude "/test"

# Complete workflow
claude "/security-scan" && claude "/create-todos" && claude "/todos-to-issues"

# TODO resolution workflow
claude "/find-todos" && claude "/fix-todos" && claude "/test"
```
