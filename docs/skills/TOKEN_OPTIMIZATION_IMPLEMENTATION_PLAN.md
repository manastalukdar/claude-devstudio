### Phase 3: Per-Skill Optimization Process

**Objective:** Apply systematic optimization to each skill

**Step-by-Step Process:**

#### Step 1: Pre-Implementation Audit
Use TOKEN_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md Pre-Implementation Checklist:

```markdown
For skill: /[skill-name]

- [ ] **Token Budget Defined**: Target range (e.g., 2,000-5,000 tokens)
- [ ] **Minimum Information Identified**: What's truly required?
  - List specific data points needed
  - Distinguish required vs. nice-to-have
- [ ] **Tool Usage Planned**:
  - [ ] Glob for discovery (50 tokens)
  - [ ] Grep for filtering (200 tokens)
  - [ ] Read for loading (2,000 tokens)
  - [ ] Task only if complex reasoning required (3,500+ tokens)
- [ ] **Caching Strategy Designed**:
  - [ ] State file location: `.claude/[skill-name]/state.json`
  - [ ] Cache validity: Time-based or checksum-based?
  - [ ] Shared cache potential with other skills?
- [ ] **Early Exit Conditions Defined**:
  - [ ] Stop after N findings
  - [ ] Confidence threshold reached
  - [ ] No relevant files found
- [ ] **Progressive Disclosure Planned**:
  - Level 1: Quick scan (500-1,000 tokens)
  - Level 2: Targeted analysis (2,000-5,000 tokens)
  - Level 3: Deep investigation (only if needed)
```

#### Step 2: Code Analysis
Read current `skills/[skill-name]/SKILL.md` and identify:

**Token-Heavy Anti-Patterns:**
- ❌ Multiple Read operations without prior Grep
- ❌ Task spawning for simple operations
- ❌ No caching implementation
- ❌ Missing early exit conditions
- ❌ Unlimited Grep results (no head_limit)
- ❌ Reading entire large files (no offset/limit)
- ❌ Speculative file reads ("just to get context")

**Optimization Opportunities:**
- ✅ Replace Read loops with Grep + targeted Read
- ✅ Add state file caching
- ✅ Implement 3-level progressive disclosure
- ✅ Add head_limit to all Grep operations
- ✅ Use appropriate Grep output_mode
- ✅ Add early exit after N findings
- ✅ Use offset/limit for large files

#### Step 3: Apply Optimization Patterns

**Pattern 1: Grep-Before-Read (90% savings)**
```markdown
# BEFORE (❌ Bad - 25,000 tokens)
for file in $(ls src/**/*.ts); do
    Read "$file"
    if [contains pattern]; then
        process file
    fi
done

# AFTER (✅ Good - 2,600 tokens)
FILES=$(Grep "pattern" glob="src/**/*.ts" output_mode="files_with_matches" head_limit=10)
for file in $FILES; do
    Read "$file"
    process file
done
```

**Pattern 2: Caching Layer (99% savings on cache hits)**
```bash
# Add to skill beginning
CACHE_FILE=".claude/[skill-name]/state.json"
CACHE_VALIDITY=3600  # 1 hour

if [ -f "$CACHE_FILE" ]; then
    LAST_RUN=$(jq -r '.timestamp' "$CACHE_FILE")
    SECONDS_SINCE=$(($(date +%s) - $(date -d "$LAST_RUN" +%s)))

    if [ $SECONDS_SINCE -lt $CACHE_VALIDITY ]; then
        echo "✓ Using cached analysis"
        jq '.results' "$CACHE_FILE"
        exit 0
    fi
fi

# Perform analysis...

# Save to cache
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$CACHE_FILE")"
cat > "$CACHE_FILE" <<EOF
{
  "timestamp": "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)",
  "results": [...]
}
EOF
```

**Pattern 3: Early Exit**
```bash
# Stop after finding N issues
MAX_FINDINGS=10
FINDINGS=0

while IFS= read -r file; do
    # Process file
    if [ issue found ]; then
        FINDINGS=$((FINDINGS + 1))
        if [ $FINDINGS -ge $MAX_FINDINGS ]; then
            echo "Found $MAX_FINDINGS issues, stopping early"
            echo "Run with --all to continue"
            break
        fi
    fi
done
```

**Pattern 4: Progressive Disclosure**
```markdown
## Phase 1: Quick Scan (500-1,000 tokens)
# Glob for structure
# Grep for obvious patterns
# Decision: Continue or stop?

## Phase 2: Targeted Analysis (2,000-5,000 tokens)
# Read matched files only
# Analyze specific issues
# Decision: Deep dive needed?

## Phase 3: Deep Investigation (only if critical findings)
# Extended thinking for complex issues
# Multi-file correlation
# Comprehensive solutions
```

**Pattern 5: Appropriate Tool Selection**
```markdown
Use Glob:
- File structure discovery
- Count files by pattern
- Build target file list
Cost: 50-100 tokens

Use Grep:
- Pattern searches
- Filter files by content
- Quick validation
Cost: 100-500 tokens

Use Read:
- Load specific matched files
- Get detailed context
- Only after Grep filtering
Cost: 500-5,000 tokens per file

Use Task:
- Complex multi-step workflows
- Extended reasoning required
- Specialized agent expertise
Cost: 3,500-50,000 tokens (use sparingly)
```

#### Step 4: Update Skill Documentation

Add to each optimized `SKILL.md`:

```markdown
**Token Optimization:**
- ✅ Uses cached analysis when available (saves 99% on cache hits)
- ✅ Grep-before-Read pattern (90% discovery savings)
- ✅ Early exit after [N] findings
- ✅ Progressive disclosure (shallow→deep only if needed)
- ✅ Expected tokens: [X]-[Y] (vs. [Z] unoptimized)
- ✅ Optimization status: Optimized
- ✅ Last reviewed: [date]

**Caching Behavior:**
- Cache location: `.claude/[skill-name]/state.json`
- Cache validity: [time period or conditions]
- Shared with: [other skills, if applicable]
```

#### Step 5: Testing & Verification

**Test Suite:**
```markdown
Test Case 1: Small Project (< 20 files)
- [ ] Run skill and measure token usage
- [ ] Verify functionality
- [ ] Check cache creation
- [ ] Run again, verify cache hit
- [ ] Expected: [X] tokens first run, [Y] cached run

Test Case 2: Medium Project (50-100 files)
- [ ] Test with realistic codebase
- [ ] Verify early exit works
- [ ] Check progressive disclosure
- [ ] Expected: [X] tokens, stops at appropriate point

Test Case 3: Large Project (500+ files)
- [ ] Test scalability
- [ ] Verify head_limit prevents explosion
- [ ] Check performance
- [ ] Expected: [X] tokens (should not grow linearly)

Verification Checklist:
- [ ] No functionality regression
- [ ] Cache hit/miss works correctly
- [ ] Early exit conditions trigger
- [ ] Token usage within budget
- [ ] User experience maintained or improved
```

2. Document token usage (estimated)
3. Document functionality
4. Note user experience

**After Optimization:**
1. Run optimized skill on same project
2. Measure token reduction
3. Verify functionality unchanged
4. Test caching (run twice)
5. Verify early exit conditions
6. Test on small/medium/large projects

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Token usage reduced by target percentage
- ✅ No functionality regression
- ✅ Caching works correctly
- ✅ Early exit triggers appropriately
- ✅ User experience maintained or improved

### Regression Testing

**Test Matrix:**
| Project Size | Files | Expected Tokens | Cache Behavior |
|--------------|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| Small | < 20 | [X] | First run creates |
| Medium | 50-100 | [Y] | Uses cache if valid |
| Large | 500+ | [Z] | Stops early, uses cache |

**Edge Cases:**
- No cache exists (first run)
- Cache expired (time-based validation)
- Cache invalid (checksum mismatch)
- Early exit triggered
- No relevant files found
- Very large files (offset/limit)

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Functionality Regression
**Mitigation:**
- Thorough testing after each optimization
- Test on multiple project sizes
- Validate edge cases
- Rollback capability if issues found

### Risk 2: Over-Optimization
**Mitigation:**
- Balance token savings with functionality
- Don't sacrifice user experience
- Allow deep analysis when warranted (Tier 3)
- Document trade-offs clearly

### Risk 3: Cache Invalidation Issues
**Mitigation:**
- Implement robust checksum validation
- Clear cache invalidation rules
- Document cache behavior
- Allow manual cache clearing

### Risk 4: Implementation Time
**Mitigation:**
- Batch approach allows incremental progress
- Learn and refine from early batches
- Parallelize independent batches if needed
- Prioritize high-impact skills first

## Appendix

### Useful Commands During Implementation

```bash
# Count current skills
ls -1 skills/ | wc -l

# Find skills with token optimization notes
grep -r "Token Optimization" skills/*/SKILL.md

# Find skills using Read without Grep
grep -r "Read \$" skills/*/SKILL.md

# Find skills with caching
grep -r ".claude/.*state.json" skills/*/SKILL.md

# Measure skill file sizes (rough proxy for complexity)
find skills/ -name "SKILL.md" -exec wc -l {} \; | sort -rn
```

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a systematic approach to applying TOKEN_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md patterns across all 99 Claude DevStudio skills. The phased, batch-based strategy ensures:

1. **Manageable Scope:** 5-10 skills per batch
2. **Validation:** Test and refine before proceeding
3. **Priority:** High-impact skills optimized first
4. **Quality:** No functionality regression
5. **Documentation:** Comprehensive tracking and reporting

**Expected Outcome:**
- 60-90% token cost reduction across all skills
- ~$319/year savings per active developer
- Faster response times and better scalability
- Zero functionality trade-offs

**Next Step:** Begin Phase 2 Batch 4 - Tier 2 Advanced Features (37 skills)
